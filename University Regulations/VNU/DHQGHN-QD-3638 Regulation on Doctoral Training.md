        receive and edit the thesis according to the comments of the
        seminar, along with an explanation of the comments received and
        the thesis finalized, the minutes of the seminar on the overall
        thesis evaluation and the thesis comments of the members of the

        seminar, with confirmation from the head of the professional
        unit to submit to the head of the professional department (for
        member universities, affiliated schools) to request the head of
        the training unit to continue the thesis evaluation process for
        the doctoral student. If the thesis does not meet the above
        requirements, the doctoral student completes the thesis and the
        training unit can organize a re-evaluation of the overall thesis
        at the seminar of the professional unit for the doctoral
        student;
    d)  For units without specialized departments (member institutes and
        affiliated institutes/departments), the head of the specialized
        unit confirms and directly requests the head of the training
        unit to continue the thesis evaluation process for doctoral
        students.

### Article 28. Independent review of thesis

1.  Within no more than 03 months from the date the thesis is approved
    at the professional unit level, the doctoral student completes the
    thesis and the professional unit sends the request to continue the
    thesis evaluation process to the postgraduate training management
    department of the training units. The affiliated training units
    transfer the above documents to the Training Department to collect
    opinions from independent reviewers to evaluate the quality of the
    thesis and prepare procedures to establish a doctoral thesis
    evaluation council for the doctoral student.
2.  The member training unit or the Training Board invites 02
    independent reviewers to review the thesis (according to the form in
    Appendix IV). The independent reviewer must meet the same standards
    as the main thesis supervisor as prescribed in Point b, Clause 1,
    Article 35 of this Regulation, and must also meet the following
    requirements:
    - Belonging to 02 different working agencies outside the training
      unit, including at least 01 reviewer outside of Hanoi National
      University. For retired people, the working agency is considered
      the unit issuing the retirement decision;
    - Not being a co-author with a doctoral student in published works
      related to the thesis topic;
    - Not working at the same agency as the doctoral student or doctoral
      supervisor;
    - No relationship between father, mother, wife, husband, child, or
      sibling with the doctoral student and the doctoral student\'s
      supervisor;
    - Not participating in the thesis evaluation session at the
      professional unit. The independent reviewer\'s opinion has
      advisory value for the head of the member training unit and the
      Director of Hanoi National University to consider and decide to
      establish a doctoral thesis evaluation council for graduate
      students.
3.  The training unit and the unit that receives the thesis evaluation
    dossier are responsible for keeping the information of the
    independent reviewer confidential. The doctoral student and the
    doctoral student\'s supervisor are not allowed to learn about,
    contact or communicate with the independent reviewer in any form.
4.  The list of independent reviewers is a confidential document of the
    training unit.
5.  Independent reviewers are responsible for reading the thesis and
    published scientific works of the doctoral student and giving their
    opinions on the scientific value, contributions, especially new
    contributions of the thesis to the specialized scientific field; the
    correct points, incorrect points or points that need to be corrected
    in the thesis; the suitability of the thesis topic with the
    industry/specialization code; the non-duplication of the topic,
    data, research results, and conclusions of the thesis with other
    topics, theses, dissertations, and scientific works; the honesty,
    clarity, and completeness of the citations; the reflection of the
    thesis results in published works; comments on the content and
    quality of published works; requirements that require the doctoral
    student to supplement and complete the thesis (if any). To conclude,
    independent reviewers need to give their opinions at one of three
    levels: agree, agree but request corrections, supplements, or
    disagree so that the thesis can be defended at the Thesis Evaluation
    Council. In case the independent reviewer evaluates at the level of
    agreement but requests for corrections and additions, the doctoral
    student needs to accept and correct, or reserve and explain, without
    having to send it back to the reviewer to get approval or
    disagreement, but must explain in writing to keep on file and
    present publicly before the Thesis Evaluation Council. The Council
    will review that content for evaluation. The independent reviewer
    keeps information about the thesis review confidential and does not
    contact the doctoral student or supervisor. All requests for
    independent review and explanation from the doctoral student or
    supervisor must go through the unit that receives the doctoral
    thesis evaluation file of the doctoral student. The independent
    reviewer sends the thesis review within the time limit according to
    the invitation letter of the training unit or the Training
    Department (maximum 02 months). After a maximum period of 03 months
    from the date the independent reviewer receives the thesis dossier,
    if the training unit or Training Board does not receive the
    independent reviewer\'s comments, the training unit or Training
    Board may invite another independent reviewer to replace it.
6.  Processing the results of independent thesis review
    a)  If both independent reviewers agree, the thesis will be defended
        at the Thesis Evaluation Council;
    b)  If one of the two independent reviewers does not agree to the
        thesis being defended at the Thesis Evaluation Council, the
        thesis must be sent to a third independent reviewer. If the
        third independent reviewer agrees, the thesis is defended at the
        Thesis Evaluation Council;
    c)  If both independent reviewers do not approve the thesis, or the
        third independent reviewer (in case the thesis requires the
        opinion of the third independent reviewer) does not approve, the
        thesis will be returned to the professional unit for the
        doctoral student to revise and the professional unit must
        re-organize a seminar to evaluate the overall thesis as
        prescribed in Article 27 of this Regulation. The doctoral
        student is only allowed to re-submit the application for
        organizing a seminar to evaluate the overall thesis no sooner
        than 03 months and no later than 06 months from the date the
        thesis is decided to be returned. The revised thesis must
        continue to undergo the independent review process as prescribed
        (second independent review). The third independent review
        process is not performed;
    d)  Comments from each independent reviewer (without the reviewer\'s
        name) are sent to the postgraduate training management
        department of the training unit to request the doctoral student
        to accept and revise according to the comments of the
        independent reviewer or to explain in order to reserve their own
        views. After the thesis is approved by the independent reviewers
        and has been revised/supplemented and completed (with
        confirmation from the supervisor and head of the professional
        unit), the postgraduate training unit will carry out procedures
        to establish a Thesis Evaluation Council for the doctoral
        student.
7.  For PhD students who are the main author of at least 03 articles
    published in journals in the WoS list or 01 patent/utility solution
    and 02 articles published in journals in the WoS list with published
    results consistent with the research topic of the thesis, they are
    exempted from the independent review process specified in Clause 2,
    Article 26 and Article 28 of this Regulation and go directly to the
    process of establishing a Thesis Evaluation Council. The assessment
    of the article\'s content consistency with the thesis\' research
    topic as well as the request for exemption from the independent
    review process is carried out by the professional subcommittee
    during the thesis evaluation session at the professional unit. The
    training unit reports to Hanoi National University for consideration
    and approval.
