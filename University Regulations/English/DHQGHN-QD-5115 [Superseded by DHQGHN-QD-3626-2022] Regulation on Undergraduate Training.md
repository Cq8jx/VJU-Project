4.  The final exam can be in the form of essay, multiple choice, oral,
    homework or a combination of these.
5.  The form of course assessment test, weight of component assessment
    test scores and final exam scores are specified in the course
    syllabus.
6.  The assessment test content must be consistent with the course
    content specified in the course syllabus. The answers and grading
    scale for the sections and the final exam must be compiled together
    with the assessment test and exam questions. The head of the

    by the lecturer or taken from the question bank.

### Article 35. Organization of assessment and final exam

1.  The assessment and grading of each course is directly conducted by
    the course lecturer and the results are announced to the students no
    later than 7 working days after the test date or the date of
    submission of the essay or assignment. Students who do not have a
    score for the assessment of the course due to a valid reason
    confirmed by the competent authority and approved by the Dean of the
    faculty under the Vietnam National University, Hanoi (or the Dean of
    the faculty of the member university), the lecturer will organize a
    supplementary assessment for the student. Students are only allowed
    to take the final exam if they have a score for the assessment of
    the course greater than 0, pay the full tuition fee and meet the
    conditions for the end of the course as prescribed by the Head of
    the unit in charge of the course.
2.  The training unit organizes the final exam of the course. For
    courses with many courses in the same semester, the final exam is
    held at the same time, with the same exam questions. At the end of
    each semester, the training unit organizes a main exam and, if
    possible, an additional exam. For each course, students are only
    allowed to take the exam once in the same exam session. The
    supplementary exam is only for students who have not taken the main
    exam for a valid reason confirmed by the competent authority and
    approved by the Head of the training unit.
3.  The schedule of the main exam must be announced at least 1 month in
    advance, the schedule of the supplementary exam must be announced at
    least 1 week in advance. During the exam, each subject is organized
    separately, and several subjects are not arranged to be combined in
    the same exam session of a student.
4.  No later than one day after the end of the course, the lecturer
    shall send a list of students who are eligible to take the final
    exam and those who are not (with reasons clearly stated) to the
    Training Department. Based on the lecturer's request and other
    obligations of the students, the Training Department shall make a
    list of students eligible to take the exam and assign exam rooms.
5.  The head of the training unit specifies the examination and grading
    procedures.
6.  Supplementary skills courses are organized for testing and
    certification at the unit in charge of supplementary skills
    training.
7.  The grading and announcement of course scores must be completed no
    later than 15 working days from the date of the end-of-course exam.
    The head of the training unit shall prescribe the procedures for
    implementing and managing section scores, end-of-course exam scores,
    and course scores.
8.  Exam papers, answers and all final exams after grading must be kept
    and archived for at least two years from the date of the exam.
    Departmental transcripts, final exam lists and summary scores of the
    course (electronic files) are permanent archives of the training
    unit.
9.  Students who are absent from the final exam without a valid reason
    will receive a score of 0 (zero). Students who are absent with a
    valid reason will be allowed to take a supplementary exam as
    prescribed in Clause 2 of this Article or will have their component
    scores retained and be allowed to take the final exam in the
    following semester.

### Article 36. Grading theses and graduation projects

1.  The head of the training unit decides to establish a thesis or
    graduation project evaluation council consisting of at least 3
    members proposed by the Dean (for member universities) or Head of
    Department (for affiliated faculties).
2.  Theses and graduation projects are graded on a 10-point scale, with
    one decimal place, and converted to letter grades according to the
    provisions of Clause 2, Article 38 of these Regulations. The
    graduation project and thesis scores are announced publicly no later
    than one week after the Graduation Project and Thesis Grading
    Councils have completed their tasks.
3.  Thesis, graduation project or alternative course grades are
    calculated into the cumulative average grade of the entire course.
4.  Students whose thesis or graduation project receives an F grade must
    re-register for the thesis or graduation project or must register
    for alternative courses according to regulations.

### Article 37. Discipline for exam invigilators, exam organizers, and exam graders

Those who participate in the work of invigilation, organization of

### Article 38. How to calculate component assessment scores and course scores

1.  Component assessment scores and final exam scores are graded on a
    10-point scale (from 0 to 10), with one decimal place.
2.  The course score is the sum of the component assessment scores and
    the final exam scores after calculating the weights specified in the
    course syllabus and rounded to one decimal place, then converted to
    a letter grade.
    a)  Type of achievement:

    - 9.0 - 10: equivalent to A+
    - 8.5 -- 8.9: corresponding to A
    - 8.0 -- 8.4: equivalent to B+
    - 7.0 - 7.9: corresponding to B
    - 6.5 - 6.9: equivalent to C+
    - 5.5 - 6.4: corresponding to C
    - 5.0 - 5.4: equivalent to D+
    - 4.0 - 4.9: corresponds to D

    b)  Failed grade: Below 4.0 corresponds to F
    c)  For subjects that do not have enough basis to be included in
        calculating the semester average score, the following symbols
        are used when assigning assessment levels:

    - I - Not enough points to evaluate the department
    - X - No final exam results yet

    d)  For courses that are allowed to transfer scores by the Head of
        the training unit or are evaluated at the beginning of the
        semester (if any), when assigning the evaluation level, use the
        symbol R written after the course score.
3.  The grading levels A+, A, B+, B, C⁺, C, D⁺, D, F are applied to the
    following cases:
    a)  Courses for which students have obtained sufficient points for
        the component assessment. In case students drop out of class,
        miss a test or exam without reason, they will not receive
        points;
    b)  Convert from level I assessment, after having had the results of
        the departmental assessment scores that the student was
        previously allowed to owe by the lecturer;
    c)  Convert from X rating level, after receiving the end of semester
        exam results.
4.  The F-grade classification, in addition to the cases specified in
    Clause 2 of this Article, also applies to cases where students
    violate exam regulations and are decided to receive an F-grade.
5.  The classification according to assessment level I is applied to the
    following cases:
    a)  During the study period or during the final exam period, if a
        student is sick or has an accident and cannot take the test or
        exam, he/she must be permitted by the Head of the training unit;
    b)  Students who are unable to take part in a departmental test or
        exam due to objective reasons and approved by the Head of the
        training unit. Except for special cases stipulated by the Head
        of the training unit, in the next semester, students receiving a
        level I assessment must complete the outstanding departmental
        test content to have their scores transferred. In case the
        student has not paid the debt and has not transferred the score
        but is not forced to drop out of school, he/she can still
        continue studying in the next semesters.
6.  The X-level grading is applied to courses for which the Training
    Department has not received the student's learning outcome report
    from the lecturer in charge of the course.

### Article 39. Assessment of learning outcomes

Students' learning outcomes are evaluated after each main semester
according to the following criteria: 1. The amount of knowledge learned
is the total number of credits of the courses (excluding free elective
courses) that the student has registered to study during the semester.
2. The amount of accumulated knowledge is the total number of credits of
the courses that have been assessed as passing, calculated from the
beginning of the course. 3. The average score of the semester is the
average score by the weight of the credits of the courses that the
student has registered to study during that semester (including the
courses assessed as passing and failing). 4. The average score of the
courses is the average score by the weight of the credits of the courses
that the student has registered to study from the beginning of the
course until the time of review (including the courses assessed as
passing and failing). 5. The cumulative average score is the average
score by the weight of the credits of the courses that have been
assessed as passing that the student has accumulated, calculated from
the beginning of the course until the time of review.

### Article 40. Method of calculating average score

1.  To calculate the semester average, course average and cumulative
    average, the letter grade of each course is converted into a score
    as follows:

- A+: equivalent to 4.0
- A: corresponds to 3.7
- B+: equivalent to 3.5
- B: corresponds to 3.0
- C+: equivalent to 2.5
- C: corresponds to 2.0
- D+: equivalent to 1.5
- D: corresponds to 1.0
- F: corresponds to 0

2.  The semester average, the course average and the cumulative average
    are calculated according to the following formula and rounded to 2
    decimal places: A = Σ(aᵢnᵢ) / Σnᵢ where: A: is the semester average
    or the course average or the cumulative average i: is the course
    number aᵢ: is the score of the i-th course nᵢ: is the number of
    credits of the i-th course in: is the total number of courses in the
    semester or the total number of courses from the beginning of the
    course to the time of review or the total number of courses
    accumulated. The assessment results of foreign language, national
    defense and security education, physical education and supplementary
    skills courses are not included in the semester average, course
    average and cumulative average. The semester GPA is used for
    academic warning, forced expulsion, temporary leave of absence,
    academic ranking, scholarships, and awards after each semester. The
    semester GPA is used for simultaneous registration of a second
    training program, and for transferring students between training
    programs. The cumulative GPA is used for academic warning, forced
    expulsion, and graduation ranking.

### Article 41. Handling of academic affairs

After each main semester, the training unit will process the academic
records. The academic results of the supplementary semester will be
included in the academic results of the main semester immediately before
the supplementary semester. 1. Academic warning The training unit will
issue academic warnings for each semester for students with the
following academic results:
    a) The cumulative average score is below
1.20 for first-year students, below 1.40 for second-year students, below
1.60 for third-year students or below 1.80 for students in the following
years and at the end of the course;
    b) The average semester score is
below 0.80 for the first semester of the course, below 1.00 for the
following semesters;
    c) The total number of credits of the courses with
an F grade remaining from the beginning of the course to the time of
review is over 24 credits. Depending on the characteristics of each
training unit, the Head of the unit shall prescribe the application of
one or two of the three above conditions to warn students about their
academic performance and prescribe the number of academic warnings, but
not more than two consecutive times. 2. Forced to leave school After
each semester, students shall be forced to leave school if they fall
into one of the following cases:
    a) The number of warnings about
academic performance exceeds the limit prescribed by the Head of the
training unit;
    b) Exceeding the maximum time allowed to study as
prescribed in Clause 1, Article 16 of this Regulation;
    c) Being
disciplined for the second time for taking an exam for someone else or
having someone else take an exam for them as prescribed in Clause d,
Clause 4, Article 32 of this Regulation or being disciplined to the
extent of removing their name from the school's student list; No later
than one month after the decision to force students to leave school, the
training unit must notify the locality where the student has permanent
residence.
    d) After the temporary leave of absence expires, the student
does not submit an application to return to school as prescribed in
Clause 3, Article 33 of these Regulations.

### Article 42. Academic ranking

1.  The academic type is the basis for determining the academic load a
    student can register for in the next semester. In case a student's
    academic type is determined after the student has registered for the
    course, the student must withdraw the course within the prescribed
    academic load limit.
2.  After each semester, based on the semester's average score,
    students' academic performance is classified into the following
    categories:
    a)  Excellent: Semester GPA from 3.60 to 4.00
    b)  Excellent: Semester GPA from 3.20 to 3.59
    c)  Good: Semester GPA from 2.50 to 3.19
    d)  Average: Semester GPA from 2.00 to 2.49
    đ)  Weak: The average semester score is below 2.00 but not yet in
