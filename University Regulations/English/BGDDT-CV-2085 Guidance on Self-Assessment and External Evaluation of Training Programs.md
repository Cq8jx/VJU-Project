### **MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING**
**DEPARTMENT OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT**

No.: 2085/QLCL-KĐCLGD
Re: Guidance on self-assessment and external evaluation of training programs

### **SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM**
**Independence - Freedom - Happiness**

*Ha Noi, December 31, 2020*

**To:**
- Higher education institutions;
- Colleges that provide teacher training;
- Education quality accreditation organizations.

To implement the self-assessment and external evaluation of training programs (CTĐT) at higher education institutions and colleges that provide teacher training in accordance with current regulations¹, the Department of Quality Management under the Ministry of Education and Training (GDĐT) provides guidance on conducting the self-assessment and external evaluation of CTĐT as follows.

---
## **Part I**
## **SELF-ASSESSMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMS**

### **I. ROLE AND REQUIREMENTS OF SELF-ASSESSMENT**

**1. Role of self-assessing training programs**

a) This is the first and important stage in assuring the quality of CTĐT at an education institution. It helps the institution that delivers the CTĐT to review, examine, and evaluate the current status of the CTĐT, accurately identify strengths and existing issues, thereby developing appropriate and feasible quality improvement plans (action plans) and implementing those plans to improve and enhance the quality of the CTĐT.

b) It is a necessary condition for the education institution to register for external evaluation and request recognition of meeting CTĐT quality standards by a KĐCLGD organization.

c) It demonstrates the institution’s autonomy and accountability in all activities of training, scientific research, and community service as assigned, consistent with its defined mission and objectives.

**2. Requirements for self-assessment of training programs**

a) During the self-assessment (TĐG) of the CTĐT, based on each standard and criterion, the education institution must focus on the following tasks:
- Describe clearly the current status of the CTĐT.
- Analyze, explain, compare, contrast, and provide judgments; indicate strengths, existing issues, and remedial measures.
- Develop action plans to improve and enhance the quality of the CTĐT.

b) Self-assessing CTĐT is a continuous process that requires significant effort and time, as well as the participation of many individuals across the entire unit delivering the CTĐT and coordination with individuals and units elsewhere in the institution.

c) CTĐT self-assessment requires objectivity, honesty, publicity, and transparency. Explanations, judgments, and conclusions given during self-assessment must be based on specific and clear evidence to ensure reliability. The self-assessment must ensure a full evaluation of all criteria within the CTĐT quality standards issued by the Ministry of Education and Training.

### **II. SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS**

The self-assessment of CTĐT is regulated from Articles 6 to 13 of Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT dated November 29, 2013 of the Minister of Education and Training promulgating the regulation on the process and cycle of quality accreditation for training programs of universities, colleges, and professional secondary schools (hereinafter referred to as Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT). The specifics are as follows:

**1. Self-assessment council**

The quantity, composition, and operating principles of the CTĐT self-assessment council shall comply with Article 7 of Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT. A sample decision on establishing the self-assessment council is provided in Annex 1.

The functions and duties of the self-assessment council shall comply with Article 8 of Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT. Relevant units within the education institution are responsible for coordinating with and supporting the council’s working groups in carrying out the self-assessment.

**2. Developing the self-assessment plan**

The self-assessment council prepares a self-assessment plan to use the institution’s time and resources effectively and ensure that the objectives of the self-assessment phase are achieved. The CTĐT self-assessment plan must present the contents specified in Clause 2 Article 9 of Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT. A sample CTĐT self-assessment plan is provided in Annex 2.

**3. Collecting, analyzing, and processing information and evidence**

a) Information and evidence

Information and evidence are understood as the documents, records, books, tapes, disks, artifacts, etc. that the institution has and that align with the connotation (requirements) of the CTĐT quality criteria. Information and evidence are used to substantiate the judgments and conclusions in the “Description of current status” section of each criterion in the self-assessment report, including the evidence and information associated with the criteria to determine each criterion’s level of achievement.

Information and evidence may be collected from the institution’s archives or relevant agencies, or from the results of surveys, investigations, interviews, and observations of institutional activities. Evidence must have a clear origin and ensure accuracy.

The information and evidence collected are used not only to evaluate the attainment levels of each criterion but also to describe the CTĐT’s activities so that readers gain a deeper understanding, thereby increasing the persuasiveness of the self-assessment report.

b) Identifying the connotation, analyzing criteria, and locating evidence

To accurately and fully identify each criterion’s connotation, note that: (i) Criteria often contain words or phrases that serve as “keywords”; (ii) The connotation of each criterion comprises one or several requirements; (iii) It is necessary to identify each criterion’s connotation in comparison with relevant regulations and with the institution’s reality during the KĐCLGD cycle; (iv) Compare the institution’s “Specific objectives” with the criterion’s connotation.

After accurately and fully identifying the criterion’s connotation, the working group or individual analyzes the criterion to determine the information and evidence to be collected, the sources of collection, and records them in the Criterion Analysis and Information/Evidence Collection Form (see Annex 3).

To assess the actual status of each requirement of a criterion, the institution can set and answer questions such as: Does the institution develop a plan to implement the requirement? Has the institution implemented and fulfilled the requirement? How does the institution’s fulfillment compare with the general regulatory requirements? How does it compare with other institutions under similar conditions (economic-social, cultural, etc.)? In what ways does the institution go “beyond” the requirement? How does the institution review and inspect the implementation of the requirement, and what quality improvements have been made? What evidence confirms that the institution has plans, implements the requirement, and reviews its implementation?

By answering these questions, the institution can analyze the criterion, orient the collection of information and evidence, and prepare for subsequent steps of the self-assessment process.

c) Collecting information and evidence

Based on the Criterion Analysis and Information/Evidence Collection Forms, the assigned working group or individual gathers information and evidence and arranges the evidence in accordance with the sequence of the criterion’s connotation.

If information or evidence for a particular criterion cannot be located (due to fire, natural disaster, missing records from previous years, etc.), the self-assessment council must clarify the reason and record it in the Criterion Evaluation Form (see Annexes 4a and 4b).

When collecting information and evidence, the self-assessment council needs to verify their reliability, authenticity, and relevance to the criterion. The council should always ask: If someone else collected the same information, would they obtain similar results? Do these data provide new, clear, and accurate insights into the CTĐT’s activities?

During the collection of information and evidence, the origin must be clearly stated. The information, evidence, and accompanying materials about their origin must be stored, along with measures to safeguard them.

*Note:* During information and evidence collection, the institution should maintain the following databases to have sufficient information and evidence for preparing the CTĐT self-assessment report: (i) Annual reports on learners’ evaluations of CTĐT quality before graduation, including processes, tools, data, and evaluation results; (ii) Annual survey reports on graduates’ employment situations, including processes, tools, data, and results; (iii) Annual survey reports on the degree to which libraries, laboratories, information technology systems, facilities, and other services meet the needs of lecturers, staff, and learners, including processes, tools, data, and results. Refer to Annex 7 for the CTĐT quality assurance database.

d) Processing and analyzing the collected information and evidence

The self-assessment council discusses the evidence for each criterion collected by the working groups or individuals. When evidence is used, the council prepares an Evidence List (see Annex 9).

In practice, some information can be used as evidence immediately, whereas other information must be processed, analyzed, and synthesized before serving as evidence to substantiate the judgments and conclusions in the “Description of current status” section of the self-assessment report. For example, most information obtained from surveys, investigations, interviews, and observations must be processed into aggregated data before it can be included as evidence in the “Description of current status.” The information collected should be processed to avoid adversely affecting the units or individuals that provided it.

Evidence appropriate to the criterion’s connotation is used in the “Description of current status” section of the Criterion Evaluation Form. Before use, the evidence must be coded for brevity and convenient retrieval. Guidance on coding evidence is provided in Annex 8.

If the institution does not store evidence in separate folders but keeps it within institutional archives, the exact location (path) of the evidence in the archives must be recorded in the Evidence List (see Annex 9).

đ) Using evidence

Each piece of evidence is coded only once. If evidence is used for multiple criteria within one standard or for several standards, it retains the code assigned the first time it was used.

The Criterion Evaluation Form (see Annexes 4a and 4b) includes sections for Description of current status, Strengths, Existing issues, Action plan, and Self-assessment (TĐG). The form is prepared by the working group or individual and submitted for the self-assessment council’s feedback. Each criterion is assessed using a separate Criterion Evaluation Form.

Evidence associated with each criterion may be presented in the “Description of current status” section of the Criterion Evaluation Form with content such as: (i) Descriptions and analyses of CTĐT activities related to the criterion; (ii) Comparisons with the criterion’s requirements (general standards), with the same CTĐT in previous years, or with State regulations to show the CTĐT’s current status; (iii) Judgments about strengths and aspects needing emphasis, identification of existing issues, and explanations of their causes; (iv) Identification of matters requiring quality improvement and proposed measures for improvement; (v) Determination of the criterion’s attainment level. For each criterion, if sufficient evidence is available to meet the criterion’s requirements, confirm that the criterion meets the requirements at the corresponding evaluation level.

Every judgment and conclusion in the “Description of current status” section of the self-assessment report must be accompanied by evidence.

From the analyses, judgments, and conclusions in the “Description of current status,” identify the CTĐT’s strengths and existing issues, and develop suitable and feasible action plans. The Criterion Evaluation Form records the results of each working group’s activities for each criterion and serves as the basis for synthesizing reports by criterion and by standard. Therefore, each working group must ensure the accuracy, honesty, and consistency of the Criterion Evaluation Forms within each standard.

The evaluation of attainment levels for the criteria is written in the Self-assessment (TĐG) section of the Criterion Evaluation Form (see Annexes 4a and 4b).

To improve the quality of the Criterion Evaluation Form, the writing process should follow these steps: (i) The working group or individual studies the criterion’s connotation and the evidence to be used to draft the form’s contents; (ii) The working group discusses the form’s contents to revise and supplement them; (iii) The self-assessment council reviews the contents of each Criterion Evaluation Form, paying particular attention to clarifying the measures, solutions, conditions (human resources, finance), implementation time, completion time, and feasibility of each action plan; (iv) Based on the council’s comments, the working group or individual finalizes the form and submits it to the council’s secretariat.

**4. Preparing the self-assessment report**

The self-assessment council prepares the self-assessment report in accordance with Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT, clearly presenting:
- The objectives, scope, and methods of the self-assessment.
- The current status assessments, attainment levels, strengths, existing issues, and improvement plans for each standard and criterion.
- The overall conclusions of the self-assessment and recommendations.

Refer to Annex 5 for the structure and format of the self-assessment report.

**5. Internal review of the self-assessment report**

The self-assessment council verifies the consistency and accuracy of the report’s contents, data, and evidence, and makes adjustments or supplements as needed. The results of the internal review and the adjustments made must be recorded and archived.

**6. Submission of the self-assessment report and related documents**

The self-assessment report and related documents must be prepared in the format prescribed by the Ministry of Education and Training and submitted to the relevant recipients. The submission package must include the Evidence List and coding list (see Annexes 9 and 8).

---

## **Part II**
## **EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF TRAINING PROGRAMS**

### **I. PREPARATION FOR EXTERNAL EVALUATION**

**1. Preparing the external evaluation registration dossier**

The education institution compiles the external evaluation registration dossier in accordance with Circular No. 38/2013/TT-BGDĐT and relevant regulations and sends it to the KĐCLGD organization. The dossier includes the self-assessment report, the evidence list, action plans, and related documents.

**2. Coordination with the external evaluation organization**

The education institution contacts the KĐCLGD organization that will conduct the external evaluation to coordinate on the evaluation plan, schedule, composition of the evaluation team, and preparation of necessary materials. The coordination results must be documented and confirmed by both parties.

### **II. IMPLEMENTING THE EXTERNAL EVALUATION**

**1. Desk review**

The external evaluation team reviews the self-assessment report and evidence submitted by the education institution and requests additional documents or explanations when necessary. The desk review results are used to prepare for the external evaluation visit.

**2. Preliminary visit**

The external evaluation team cooperates with the institution to conduct a preliminary visit to agree on the visit’s objectives, contents, schedule, and required evidence. The preliminary visit results are recorded using the memorandum template in Annex 13.

**3. Official visit**

During the official visit, the external evaluation team verifies evidence, interviews stakeholders, conducts on-site observations, and reviews supplementary documents. The outcomes of each activity are recorded and synthesized using the report template in Annex 15.

**4. Preparing the external evaluation report**

Based on the official visit results, the external evaluation team prepares the external evaluation report, including assessments of each standard and criterion, strengths and existing issues, and recommendations for improvement. Refer to Annex 17 for the report template.

### **III. FOLLOW-UP AFTER EXTERNAL EVALUATION**

**1. Submission and disclosure of the report**

The external evaluation report must be sent to the education institution and relevant agencies within the prescribed timeframe and disclosed as required. Upon receipt, the institution reviews the report and takes necessary actions.

**2. Implementation of improvement plans**

The education institution develops and implements improvement plans based on the recommendations in the external evaluation report. Progress is monitored regularly and reported to the KĐCLGD organization and the supervisory authority.

The CTĐT self-assessment report consists of Part I. Overview; Part II. Self-assessment by standards and criteria; Part III. Conclusion; and Part IV. Annexes. Details are as follows:

#### **Part I. Overview**

**1. Introduction**

a) Summarize the CTĐT self-assessment report (structure and key contents by standard) and explain the method used to code evidence in the report.

b) Briefly describe the objectives, process, methods, and tools of the CTĐT self-assessment to provide contextual information that helps readers better understand the report; describe the participation of stakeholders (faculties, departments, offices, administrators, lecturers, staff, learners, etc.) and how these groups were involved in the self-assessment.

**2. General overview (approximately 10 pages)**

Provide readers with the overall context and a holistic view of the education institution and the CTĐT implementing unit before presenting detailed analysis. Summarize the institution’s mission, vision, objectives, quality policies, and quality assurance activities, as well as those of the CTĐT implementing unit. This section may also mention changes since the previous self-assessment and their impact on the CTĐT implementing unit (if any).

#### **Part II. Self-assessment by standards and criteria**

This is the core of the CTĐT self-assessment report, detailing the education institution’s self-assessment results for the CTĐT. Each CTĐT quality standard is examined in turn, and each criterion within the standard is evaluated using the following structure:

**Standard 1**

**Introduction** (brief): Summarize the overall description and analysis of the standard (to avoid repeating overlapping contents among criteria within the standard).

**Criterion 1.1..................**

1. Description of current status

Describe fully, accurately, and objectively the current activities of the education institution implementing the CTĐT in line with each criterion’s connotation. Attach evidence to every judgment, conclusion, and assessment in this section.

2. Strengths

Based on the description of current status, and considering the institution’s mission and objectives as well as the functions and duties of the CTĐT implementing unit, assess the quality and effectiveness of activities under each criterion. Identify the CTĐT’s outstanding strengths relative to the criterion’s requirements and explain the assessments.

3. Existing issues

Based on the description of current status, and considering the institution’s mission and objectives as well as the functions and duties of the CTĐT implementing unit, assess the quality and effectiveness of activities under each criterion. Identify the CTĐT’s prominent existing issues relative to the criterion’s requirements and explain the assessments.

4. Action plan

Propose plans to maintain strengths and solutions to address existing issues. Plans must be specific and feasible, indicating remedial measures, resources, completion timelines, and monitoring methods.

5. Self-assessment

a) For self-assessments conducted under the CTĐT quality standards for higher education levels promulgated together with Circulars No. 04/2016/TT-BGDĐT, No. 02/2020/TT-BGDĐT, No. 39/2020/TT-BGDĐT: indicate Achieved/Not achieved and the level (1 to 7).

### **Annex 8. Guidance on coding information and evidence**

Education institutions with training programs under evaluation may encode information and evidence (evidence codes) using a string consisting of at least 11 characters, including one letter, three periods, and seven digits, with a period separating each pair of digits, according to the following formula: **Hn.ab.cd.ef.**

Where:

- **H:** abbreviation of “evidence box” (the evidence for each standard is stored in one or more boxes).
- **n:** ordinal number of the evidence box, numbered from 1 upward (if n ≥ 10, the symbol string has 12 or more characters).
- **ab:** ordinal number of the standard (standard 1 is written as 01, standard 10 as 10).
- **cd:** ordinal number of the criterion (criterion 1 is written as 01, criterion 10 as 10).
- **ef:** ordinal number of the evidence for each criterion (the first piece of information/evidence is written as 01, the 15th as 15, etc.).

Examples:

- H1.01.01.01: the first evidence of criterion 1, standard 1, stored in box 1.
- H3.03.02.15: the 15th evidence of criterion 2, standard 3, stored in box 3.
- H4.04.03.25: the 25th evidence of criterion 3, standard 4, stored in box 4.
- H8.10.02.04: the 4th evidence of criterion 2, standard 10, stored in box 8.
- H10.10.02.04: the 4th evidence of criterion 2, standard 10, stored in box 10.

### **Annex 19. Formatting and structure of the self-assessment and external evaluation reports**

**I. Formatting of the self-assessment and external evaluation reports**
Guidance on presenting the self-assessment report and the external evaluation report
- The self-assessment report and the external evaluation report must be concise, clear, coherent, and free of erasures. The reports should be edited to ensure consistency in presentation, wording, terminology, and to avoid spelling and grammatical errors.
- The self-assessment report and the external evaluation report should not exceed 200 A4 pages, excluding annexes. Tables, charts, graphs, illustrations, maps, and photos may be printed on A3 paper. The reports should be bound (softcover or hardcover) for long-term use (along with the electronic file).
- Do not overuse abbreviations in the reports. Only abbreviate words, phrases, or terms that are used more than three times in the report. Do not abbreviate overly long phrases or clauses, nor words or phrases that appear infrequently. When words, phrases, terms, or names of agencies or organizations are abbreviated, the first occurrence must be written in full with the abbreviation in parentheses. Reports containing abbreviations must include a list of abbreviations (arranged alphabetically) at the beginning of the report.
