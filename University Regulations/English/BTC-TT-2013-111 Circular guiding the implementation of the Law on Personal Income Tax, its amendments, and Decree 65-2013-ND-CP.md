### **Chapter I**
### **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Article 1. Taxpayers**

Taxpayers comprise resident individuals and non-resident individuals as prescribed in Article 2 of the Law on Personal Income Tax and Article 2 of Government Decree No. 65/2013/ND-CP dated 27 June 2013 detailing a number of articles of the Law on Personal Income Tax and the Law amending and supplementing a number of articles of the Law on Personal Income Tax (hereinafter referred to as “Decree No. 65/2013/ND-CP”), who receive taxable income as provided in Article 3 of the Law on Personal Income Tax and Article 3 of Decree No. 65/2013/ND-CP.

The scope for determining taxable income of taxpayers is prescribed as follows:

* Resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on income arising within and outside the territory of Viet Nam, regardless of the place where the income is paid or received.
* Non-resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on income arising in Viet Nam, regardless of the place where the income is paid or received.

1. A resident individual is a person who satisfies one of the following conditions:

   a) Being present in Viet Nam for 183 days or more within one calendar year or for 12 consecutive months counting from the first day of arrival in Viet Nam, in which the day of arrival and the day of departure are each counted as one (01) day. The days of arrival and departure are determined according to the confirmation of the immigration control authority on the individual’s passport (or laissez-passer) when the individual enters and leaves Viet Nam. Where a person enters and leaves on the same day, such day is counted as one day of residence.

   The presence in Viet Nam referred to in this Point means the individual’s physical presence within the territory of Viet Nam.

   b) Having a regular place of residence in Viet Nam in either of the following cases:

   b.1) Having a regular place of residence in accordance with the law on residence:

   b.1.1) For Vietnamese citizens: the regular place of residence is the place where the individual lives stably and permanently without a definite term at a certain dwelling and has registered permanent residence in accordance with the law on residence.

   b.1.2) For foreigners: the regular place of residence is the permanent residence stated in the Permanent Residence Card or the temporary residence recorded when applying for a Temporary Residence Card issued by the competent authority under the Ministry of Public Security.

   b.2) Leasing a dwelling in Viet Nam under the law on housing with a term of lease contracts totalling 183 days or more in a tax year, in particular:

   b.2.1) An individual who has not established or does not have a regular place of residence as guided at Point b.1 of this Clause but has a total number of days renting a dwelling according to lease contracts of 183 days or more in the tax year shall also be identified as a resident individual, including cases of leasing multiple dwellings.

   b.2.2) Rented dwellings include cases of staying in hotels, guest houses, inns, dormitories, workplaces, offices, and other similar places, regardless of whether the individual personally signs the lease or the employer leases the premises for the employee.

   Where an individual has a regular place of residence in Viet Nam as prescribed in this Clause but is actually present in Viet Nam for fewer than 183 days in the tax year and the individual cannot prove resident status in any other country, that individual shall be treated as a resident individual in Viet Nam.

   Proof of residence in another country is based on a certificate of residence. Where the individual is from a country or territory that has entered into a tax treaty with Viet Nam but does not issue certificates of residence, the individual shall provide a certified copy of the passport to evidence the period of residence.

2. A non-resident individual is a person who does not satisfy the conditions specified in Clause 1 of this Article.

3. Taxpayers in certain specific cases are determined as follows:

   a) For individuals earning income from business activities:

   a.1) Where only one person is named in the business registration certificate, the taxpayer is the individual named in the business registration certificate.

   a.2) Where multiple persons are jointly named in the business registration certificate (a group of individuals conducting business) and jointly engage in business activities, each person named in the business registration certificate is a taxpayer.

   a.3) Where multiple people in a household jointly conduct business but only one person is named in the business registration certificate, the taxpayer is the individual named in the business registration certificate.

   a.4) Where individuals or households actually conduct business without holding a business registration certificate (or professional practising certificate, license), the taxpayer is the individual conducting the business activities.

   a.5) For activities of leasing houses, land-use rights, water surfaces, or other assets without business registration, the taxpayer is the individual who owns the house, land-use right, water surface, or other assets. Where multiple individuals jointly own the house, land-use right, water surface, or other assets, each owner is a taxpayer corresponding to their ownership or use rights.

   b) For individuals earning other taxable income:

   b.1) Where real estate that is jointly owned is transferred, each co-owner is a taxpayer for the income from the transfer.

   b.2) Where an individual authorises another to manage real estate and the authorised person has the right to transfer the real estate or to exercise rights as if the owner under the law, the taxpayer is the individual who authorises the real estate.

   b.3) Where the ownership or use rights over objects protected under the Law on Intellectual Property or the Law on Technology Transfer are transferred and such objects are jointly owned or co-authored by multiple individuals, each owner or author who receives income from the transfer is a taxpayer.

   b.4) Where multiple individuals participate in franchising under the Law on Commerce, each individual receiving income from the franchise is a taxpayer.

4. Taxpayers as guided in Clauses 1 and 2 of this Article include:

   a) Vietnamese nationals, including those seconded to work, perform services, or study abroad who derive taxable income.

   b) Individuals who do not hold Vietnamese nationality but derive taxable income, including foreigners working in Viet Nam and foreigners who are not physically present in Viet Nam but have taxable income arising in Viet Nam.
