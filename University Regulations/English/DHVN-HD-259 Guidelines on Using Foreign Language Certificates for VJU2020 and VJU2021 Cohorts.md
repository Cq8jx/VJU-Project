Vietnam-Japan University (VJU) issues the following guidance on using foreign language certificates and attestations for confirming graduation requirements and organising foreign language modules for full-time undergraduate students of the VJU2020 and VJU2021 cohorts.

### 1. Scope of application

Full-time undergraduate students of the VJU2020 and VJU2021 cohorts.

### 2. Graduation requirements

Prior to graduation, students must submit a valid foreign language certificate or attestation aligned with the Vietnamese Six-Level Foreign Language Proficiency Framework and meeting the programme’s graduation requirement, as follows:

| No. | Programme | Vietnamese Foreign Language Proficiency Framework |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | **English** | **Japanese** |
| 1 | Japanese Studies | Level 3 | Level 4 |
| 2 | Computer Science and Engineering | Level 4 | – |

- See Appendix 1 for the list of certificates and attestations recognised by VNU. *Note: certificates/attestations are valid for two years from the test date.*

### 3. Recognition of learning outcomes for foreign language modules in the curriculum

#### 3.1. High-quality Computer Science and Engineering programme

Students who submit a valid English certificate receive recognition for the following modules in the General Knowledge Block (M1):

| No. | Vietnamese Foreign Language Proficiency Framework | Result | Modules granted recognition | Module code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Level 3 | Pass | English B1 | FLF1107 |
| 2 | Level 4 | Pass | English B1 and English B2 | FLF1107, FLF1108 |

#### 3.2. High-quality Japanese Studies programme

**a) English**

- Recognition applies only to the English B1 module (FLF1107) in the disciplinary knowledge block and solely for the VNU-TESTS certificate (foreign language proficiency assessment oriented toward professional communication at VNU). Other foreign language certificates are not accepted.
- Recognition based on the VNU-TESTS certificate is as follows:

| No. | Test format | Recognised score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | English Level 3 | 9.0 |
| 2 | English Level 4 | 10.0 |

**b) Japanese**

- Students follow Clause 3.1, Article 3 of Guideline No. 784/ĐHVN-ĐT dated 9 October 2020 on organising foreign language modules in undergraduate programmes regarding Japanese B1 and Japanese B2 modules in the General Knowledge Block (M1).
- Recognised certificates and attestations are listed in Appendix 1 of this Guideline.

### 4. Additional notes

- Certificates/attestations must be valid at the time of submission. Students submit one notarised copy to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services (Room 501, My Dinh Campus). Students who sat the JLPT must also submit the authorisation form in Appendix 2.
- Students already named in a Rector’s decision recognising fulfillment of graduation requirements are not required to resubmit their certificate.
- Certificates or attestations obtained via online examinations are not recognised by VJU.
- Students are encouraged to submit certificates early to ensure sufficient time for verification prior to graduation consideration.
- For enquiries, contact the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services (email: phongdaotao@st.vju.ac.vn).
