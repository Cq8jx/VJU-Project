Vietnam-Japan University (VJU) provides the following guidelines on organising undergraduate theses and graduation projects (hereinafter referred to as “thesis/project” or “KL, ĐA”) for its full-time undergraduate students:

## I. General information

### 1. Scope and applicability

- These guidelines govern the organisation and implementation of theses/projects in undergraduate programmes at VJU.
- They apply to relevant functional offices, faculties, training programmes, supervising lecturers (hereinafter “supervisors”) and full-time undergraduate students at VJU (hereinafter “students”).

### 2. Objectives

- Define the timeline for implementing theses/projects.
- Specify the requirements throughout the thesis/project process in line with the applicable VNU undergraduate education regulations and other regulations in force at VJU.
- Guide faculties, training programmes, supervisors and students in carrying out the related tasks according to the thesis/project implementation schedule (Appendix 1).

## II. Eligibility and student obligations

### 1. Eligibility to undertake a thesis/project

- Students must not be under disciplinary suspension or criminal investigation, and must be compliant with the University’s tuition payment regulations.
- At the time of registration: students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 by the end of the third academic year and have completed the modules “Scientific Research Methodology” and “Professional Internship” in the programme curriculum.
- At the time of the defence: students must have completed all major-specific modules in the curriculum (excluding the thesis/project module); must obtain a plagiarism check result from the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance showing a duplication rate below 20%; and must submit the defence application signed by the supervisor (Guidance Log, Appendix 3).

## V. Thesis/project evaluation committee

### 1. Composition

- The Rector of VJU establishes thesis/project evaluation committees based on recommendations from the Dean and the Head of the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services.
- Each committee comprises 5 to 7 members, including one chair, one secretary, two reviewers, a representative of the supervisor(s) and other members.

### 2. Member requirements

- The chair and reviewers must hold a doctoral degree or higher and have at least two years of research and teaching experience.
- Other members must hold at least a master’s degree and have at least two years of research and teaching experience.

## VI. Organisation of thesis/project assessment

### 1. Conditions for conducting the assessment

- The defence may proceed when at least two-thirds of committee members are physically present, including the chair, secretary and at least one reviewer.
- A representative of the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services must attend the defence.
- Any absent member must notify the chair; their score sheets and reviewer comments (if applicable) must be sealed, signed and delivered to the chair.

### 2. Assessment criteria

- Based on the proposal from the training programme, the Rector stipulates the assessment criteria for theses/projects.
- Criteria include content, presentation, defence performance and research achievements (if any). Faculties develop a marking scheme using a 10-point scale (rounded to one decimal) in accordance with VNU’s undergraduate regulations and convert scores to letter grades.
- Scores are announced publicly at the defence session.
- Students receiving an F must re-register for the thesis/project within two months of receiving the result. Only one re-registration is permitted. A second F results in ineligibility for graduation consideration.

### 3. Defence procedures

#### 3.1. In-person defence

1. At least five working days before the defence, students submit two hard copies and a PDF of the thesis/project to the programme so committee members can review and comment.
2. The faculty sends guidance documents and forms (score sheets and reviewer comments) together with the digital thesis/project to committee members.
3. One day before the defence, the faculty prepares facilities, equipment, documents and records for the session.
4. Defence session sequence:
   - Step 1: A faculty representative states the purpose of the session, introduces guests (if any) and announces the list of presenting students.
   - Step 2: The committee secretary reads the decision establishing the committee, introduces the members and invites the chair to preside.
   - Step 3: The chair confirms attendance and, if quorum is met, directs the proceedings.
   - Step 4: The secretary invites the student to prepare for the presentation.
   - Step 5: The student presents a summary of the thesis/project within 10–15 minutes.
   - Step 6: The two reviewers deliver their assessments after the presentation. If a reviewer is absent, the secretary reads out their written review and score sheet as authorised by the chair.
   - Step 7: Committee members question the student, and the student responds.
   - Step 8: After all questions have been answered, the supervisor’s representative comments on the student’s work.
   - Step 9: The committee deliberates in private. Members record their scores on the score sheets and submit them to the secretary.
   - Step 10: The secretary consolidates the scores, completes the minutes and reads them aloud to the committee for confirmation before submitting them to the chair.
   - Step 11: The secretary publicly announces the committee’s conclusions, including the defence score and required revisions, to all students in attendance.

#### 3.2. Online defence

- If an in-person defence is not possible, the defence may be held online provided that:
  - Approval is obtained from the VJU Rectorate Board.
  - The assessment is conducted by a specialised committee of at least five members.
  - All committee members and students consent to the online format.
  - The entire session is recorded (audio and video) and archived in accordance with regulations.
- The online defence follows the same steps as the in-person defence.

### 4. Submission of theses/projects

#### 4.1. Student revisions and submission

- Students revise the thesis/project based on the committee’s conclusions and submit the digital file to the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance for a final plagiarism check. If the similarity index is 20% or higher, the student continues revising as instructed. If it is below 20%, the student completes the Revision Confirmation Form (Appendix 3) signed by the student, supervisor and committee chair.
- Within three working days from the official announcement of the score, students submit the revised thesis/project in person: two hard copies, one complete PDF and one PDF summary. The Revision Confirmation Form must be bound into the final hard copy.

#### 4.2. Faculty compilation

- Faculties compile students’ files (full thesis/project PDFs and summary PDFs) into folders named “Programme_Student Name_Student ID” (see the summary compilation template for faculties in Appendix 1.5).
- Faculties send all files to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services at graduation_ug@st.vju.ac.vn.
- Faculties submit hard-copy score sheets signed by the committee chair and secretary to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services.
