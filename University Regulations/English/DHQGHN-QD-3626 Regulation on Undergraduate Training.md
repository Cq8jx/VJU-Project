### Article 41. How to calculate component assessment scores and course scores

1.  Component assessment scores and final exam scores are graded on a
    10-point scale (from 0 to 10), with one decimal place.
2.  The course score is the sum of the component assessment scores and
    the final exam scores after calculating the weights specified in the
    course syllabus and rounded to one decimal place, then converted to
    a letter grade.
    a)  Graded type:

    - 9.0 -- 10: equivalent to A+
    - 8.0 -- 8.4: equivalent to B+
    - 6.5 -- 6.9: equivalent to C+
    - 5.0 -- 5.4: equivalent to D+
    - 8.5 -- 8.9: corresponding to A
    - 7.0 -- 7.9: corresponding to B
    - 5.5 -- 6.4: corresponding to C
    - 4.0 -- 4.9: corresponds to D

    b)  Ungraded pass type: applies to courses that only require
        passing, not counted in the average academic score; P: from 5.0
        and above.
    c)  Failed grade: Below 4.0 corresponds to F
    d)  For subjects that do not have enough basis to be included in
        calculating the semester average score, the following symbols
        are used when assigning assessment levels:

    - I - Not enough points to evaluate the department
    - X - No final exam results yet d) For courses that are allowed by
      the Head of the training unit to be recognized for credits,
      transferred scores or assessed at the beginning of the semester
      (if any), when assigning assessment levels, use the symbol R
      written after the course score.
3.  The grading levels A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, F are applied to the
    following cases:
    a)  Courses for which students have achieved sufficient component
        assessment scores;
    b)  Convert from level I assessment, after having had the results of
        the departmental assessment scores that the student was
        previously allowed to owe by the lecturer;
    c)  Convert from X rating level after receiving end of term exam
        results.
4.  The F-grade classification, in addition to the cases specified in
    Clause 2 of this Article, also applies to cases where students
    violate exam regulations and are decided to receive an F-grade.
5.  The classification according to assessment level I is applied to the
    following cases:
    a)  During the study period or during the final exam period, if a
        student is sick or has an accident and cannot take the test or
        exam, he/she must be permitted by the Head of the training unit;
    b)  Students cannot take part in departmental tests or exams for
        objective reasons and must be approved by the Head of the
        training unit.

## Chapter VII: IMPLEMENTATION ORGANIZATION

### Article 42. Assessment of learning outcomes

Students' learning outcomes are evaluated after each main semester
according to the following criteria: 1. The amount of knowledge learned
is the total number of credits of the courses (excluding free elective
courses) that the student has registered to study during the semester.
2. The amount of accumulated knowledge is the total number of credits of
the courses that have been assessed as passing, calculated from the
beginning of the course. 3. The average score of the semester is the
average score by the weight of the credits of the courses that the
student has registered to study during that semester (including the
courses assessed as passing and failing). 4. The average score of the
courses is the average score by the weight of the credits of the courses
that the student has registered to study from the beginning of the
course until the time of review (including the courses assessed as
passing and failing). 5. The cumulative average score is the average
score by the weight of the credits of the courses that have been
assessed as passing that the student has accumulated, calculated from
the beginning of the course until the time of review.

### Article 43. Method of calculating average score

1.  To calculate the semester average, course average and cumulative
    average, the letter grade of each course is converted into a score
    as follows:

- A+: equivalent to 4.0
- A: corresponds to 3.7
- B+: equivalent to 3.5
- B: corresponds to 3.0
- C+: equivalent to 2.5
- C: corresponds to 2.0
- D+: equivalent to 1.5
- D: corresponds to 1.0
- F: corresponds to 0

2.  The semester average, the course average, and the cumulative average
    are calculated according to the following formula and rounded to 2
    decimal places: A = Σ(aᵢnᵢ) / Σnᵢ where: A: is the semester average
    or the course average or the cumulative average i: is the course
    number aᵢ: is the score of the i-th course nᵢ: is the number of
    credits of the i-th course in: is the total number of courses in the
    semester or the total number of courses from the beginning of the
    course to the time of review or the total number of courses
    accumulated. The assessment results of the national defense -
    security education and physical education courses are not included
    in the semester average, the course average, and the cumulative
    average. The semester average is used to consider academic warnings,
    forced expulsion, temporary leave of absence, academic ranking,
    scholarships, and rewards after each semester. The average score of
    each course is used to register for a second training program at the
    same time, transfer students between training programs. The
    cumulative average score is used for academic warning, forced
    dismissal, and graduation ranking.

### Article 44. Handling of academic affairs

After each main semester, the training unit will process the academic
affairs. The academic results of the supplementary semester will be
included in the academic results of the main semester immediately before
the supplementary semester. 1. Academic warning The training unit will
issue academic warnings for each semester for students with the
following academic results:
    a) The cumulative average score is below
1.20 for first-year students, below 1.40 for second-year students, below
1.60 for third-year students or below 1.80 for students in the following
years and at the end of the course;
    b) The average score for the
semester is below 0.80 for the first semester of the course, below 1.00
for the following semesters;
    c) The total number of credits of the
courses with an F grade remaining from the beginning of the course to
the time of consideration is over 24 credits or the total number of
credits not achieved in the semester exceeds 50% of the registered
course load in the semester. Depending on the characteristics of each
training unit, the head of the unit shall prescribe the application of
one or two of the three above conditions to warn students about their
academic performance and prescribe the number of academic warnings, but
not more than two consecutive times. 2. Forced to leave school After
each semester, students shall be forced to leave school if they fall
into one of the following cases:
    a) The number of warnings about
academic performance exceeds the limit prescribed by the Head of the
training unit;
    b) Exceeding the maximum time allowed to study as
prescribed in Clause 1, Article 17 of this Regulation;
    c) Being
disciplined for the second time for the reason of taking an exam for
someone else or having someone else take an exam for them as prescribed
in Point d, Clause 4, Article 35 of this Regulation or being disciplined

student has permanent residence.
    đ) After the temporary leave of absence
expires, the student does not submit an application to return to school
as prescribed in Clause 3, Article 36 of these Regulations.

### Article 45. Academic ranking

1.  The academic type is the basis for determining the academic load a
    student can register for in the next semester. In case a student's
    academic type is determined after the student has registered for the
    course, the student must withdraw the course within the prescribed
    academic load limit.
2.  After each semester, based on the semester's average score,
    students' academic performance is classified into the following
    categories:
    a)  Excellent: Semester GPA from 3.60 to 4.00
    b)  Excellent: Semester GPA from 3.20 to 3.59
    c)  Good: Semester GPA from 2.50 to 3.19
    d)  Average: Semester GPA from 2.00 to 2.49 points) Weak: Semester
        GPA below 2.0 but not yet in the case of forced expulsion.
