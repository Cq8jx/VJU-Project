# GUIDELINES

**Recognition of learning outcomes and credit transfer for undergraduate students of Vietnam-Japan University**

Pursuant to Decision No. 1186/QĐ-TTg dated 21 July 2014 of the Prime Minister establishing Vietnam-Japan University under Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU); Decision No. 391/QĐ-TTg dated 31 March 2017 of the Prime Minister promulgating the Charter on the organisation and operation of Vietnam-Japan University under VNU; Decision No. 5115/QĐ-ĐHQGHN dated 25 December 2014 of VNU issuing the Regulations on undergraduate education; and Decision No. 3626/QĐ-ĐHQGHN dated 21 October 2022 of VNU issuing the revised Regulations on undergraduate education;

Vietnam-Japan University (VJU) hereby provides guidance on recognising learning outcomes and transferring credits for students enrolled in VJU undergraduate programmes as follows:

## I. Scope of application

All students enrolled in VJU undergraduate programmes.

## II. Principles for recognition and credit transfer

1. Courses previously completed by students may be recognised and converted on the basis of matching learning outcomes, content and workload, assessment methods and quality assurance conditions.
2. Foreign language certificates or attestations recognised by VJU (as officially published in the University’s annual notices) may be converted into credits for foreign language modules in the curriculum.
3. A student’s scientific research output may replace an eligible elective module within the disciplinary knowledge block if the work has been evaluated by the Academic Council using a 10-point scale and meets quality and applicability criteria aligned with the relevant module’s content and programme learning outcomes. For details on research achievements, refer to Article 29 of Regulation 5115 or Article 32 of Regulation 3626 on undergraduate education at VNU.
4. For students changing majors, specialisations or programmes, or those pursuing double-degree study, the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services (AASS) processes recognition and credit transfer according to the approved list of equivalent modules.
5. Credit limits:
   - The total recognised credit load may not exceed 50% of the minimum credits required by the programme.
   - For student exchanges, credits earned outside VNU may not exceed 25% of the programme’s total credits.

## III. Procedures

1. Students submit an application for recognition and credit transfer together with supporting documents (notarised transcripts, foreign language certificates/attestations).
2. The Academic Council reviews the submission in line with these guidelines, determines the eligible courses and forwards the approved dossier to the AASS Office.
3. Upon approval by the Rectorate Board, the AASS Office records the converted results in VJU’s academic management system.

## IV. Implementation

These guidelines take effect on the date signed. Any issues arising during implementation should be reported to the Rectorate Board via the AASS Office for timely resolution.

- Rector (for reporting);
- Faculties (for implementation);
