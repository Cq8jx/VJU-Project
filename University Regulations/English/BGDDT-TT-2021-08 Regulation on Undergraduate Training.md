    and the form of work-study. Training programs awarded degrees by
    foreign educational institutions, including joint training programs,
    are subject to this regulation or the regulations of the training
    institution granting degrees according to the agreement on
    cooperation between the parties but not contrary to the provisions
    of this regulation.
3.  This regulation is the basis for training institutions to develop

    from subjects or modules (hereinafter referred to as modules), in
    which there must be enough compulsory modules and meet the training
    program standards according to current regulations of the Ministry
    of Education and Training. In the case of dual major or major -
    minor training, the training program must clearly show the general
    and specific learning volume for each major.
2.  The content and output standards of the training program apply to
    different forms, training methods and learners. For those who have
    graduated from other levels or majors, the actual learning volume is
    determined based on recognition or conversion of accumulated credits
    and exemption of subjects in the previous training program.
3.  The training program must be made public to learners before
    enrollment and at the beginning of the course; changes and
    adjustments related to the training program must be made in
    accordance with current regulations and announced before

4.  For each form of training, the training program needs to provide a
    standard full-course study plan to guide students.
    a)  The time according to the standard full-course study plan for

    the requirements of the training program that the student has
    studied and has scores according to the following criteria:
    a)  Total credits of courses that students fail in a semester, in a
        school year, or have outstanding debts from the beginning of the
        course;
    b)  Total credits of the courses that the student has achieved from
        the beginning of the course (cumulative credits), including
        exempted courses and recognized credits;
    c)  The average score of the courses that a student has studied in a
        semester (semester average), in a school year (school year
        average) or from the beginning of the course (cumulative
        average), calculated according to the official score of the
        course and the weight is the number of credits of that course.
2.  To calculate the average score, the letter grade of the course is
    converted to a numerical score as below, except for the case
    specified in Clause 4 of this Article. Letter grades with more
    levels as prescribed by the training institution (if any) are also
    converted to corresponding numerical scores on a scale from 0 to 4.

    converted to 1; F is converted to 0.
3.  Letter grades not specified in Clause 2 of this Article shall not be
    counted towards semester, year or cumulative grade point averages.
    Courses not included in the requirements of the training program
    shall not be counted towards the criteria for assessing students'
    learning outcomes.
4.  Training institutions that are training according to the academic
    year system and using the 10-point scale shall calculate average
    scores based on course scores on the 10-point scale, without
    converting letter grades to the 4-point scale. In this case, the
    training institution's regulations shall specifically stipulate the
    levels of handling learning outcomes to be equivalent to and replace
    the provisions in Article 12 of this Regulation.
5.  Students are classified according to their semester average, yearly
    average or cumulative average as follows:
    a)  On a 4-point scale: From 3.6 to 4.0: Excellent; From 3.2 to near
        3.6: Good; From 2.5 to near 3.2: Fair; From 2.0 to near 2.5:

    accumulated from the beginning of the course (abbreviated as N) and
    the average number of credits per academic year according to the
    standard study plan (abbreviated as M), specifically as follows:
    a)  First year level: N \< M;
    b)  Second year level: M ≤ N \< 2M;
