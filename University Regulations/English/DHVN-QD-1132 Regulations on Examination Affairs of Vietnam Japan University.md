**on Examination Affairs of Vietnam Japan University**
**(Promulgated together with Decision No. 1132/QĐ-ĐHVN dated 1 October 2025)**

---

### CHAPTER I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

**Article 1. Scope of regulation and subjects of application**

1. These Regulations prescribe the functions, tasks, powers, and responsibilities of the individuals and units participating in examination affairs at Vietnam Japan University. Examination affairs cover activities related to tests and assessment throughout the learning process of learners.
2. Subjects of application: Faculties in charge of modules (hereinafter referred to as Faculties), academic programs (undergraduate, postgraduate, and the Japanese Language Education Program, hereinafter collectively referred to as Programs), lecturers, undergraduate students, graduate students (hereinafter collectively referred to as learners), the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance (KT&ĐBCL), the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services (ĐT&CTSV), the Inspectorate–Legal Affairs Division (TT-PC), and other relevant functional offices.

**Article 2. Objectives and principles for organising examination activities**

1. Objectives:
   a. Ensure that examination activities are implemented strictly in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU), and Vietnam Japan University (VJU).
   b. Ensure that assessments accurately measure the achievement of course learning outcomes (CLOs) and program learning outcomes (PLOs) of learners.
   c. Guarantee consistency, objectivity, fairness, and accuracy in examination affairs, thereby contributing to the enhancement of training quality.
   d. Promote proactiveness in organising and managing examination affairs at VJU.
2. Principles for organising examination activities:
   a. Examination affairs are common responsibilities of the University under the leadership of the Board of Rectors, with the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance acting as the focal point. Units and individuals must participate in accordance with their assigned duties.
   b. Lecturers and administrative staff mobilised to participate in examination activities must fulfil their assigned tasks. Units shall facilitate the staff involved so that they can complete the work.
   c. The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance shall organise and supervise examination activities in compliance with the regulations; ensure synchronisation, accuracy, and timeliness; and resolutely prevent and strictly handle all violations and misconduct related to examination affairs at the University.

**Article 3. Definitions**

1. **Assessment** refers to the process of appraising value. Assessment of learning outcomes is the comparison and evaluation of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and competencies actually achieved by learners before, during, or after the learning process against the expected outcomes specified in the teaching objectives. In higher education, assessment comprises a series of tasks performed by lecturers to gather information on learner performance and achievement.
2. **Testing and evaluation** is the measurement and collection of information to judge how learners have acquired knowledge, skills, attitudes, or competencies after studying, while also providing feedback to improve the teaching and learning process. Testing is a form of assessment whereby lecturers apply methods to measure learning at a specific point in time. Test results are usually expressed as scores and provide the data required for assessment.
3. **Outcome-based assessment** means establishing a process to measure learners’ performance, provide feedback, and help them improve their achievement. It also enables lecturers to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching. Outcome-based assessment gathers evidence of learning in relation to the number of outcomes attained by learners rather than the total scores of separate assessment tasks. In higher education two common forms are formative and summative assessment.
4. **Formative assessment** is conducted regularly during the delivery of a course. It provides feedback to learners about their grasp of knowledge and areas that require improvement, and helps instructors design appropriate teaching methods to enhance instruction. Effective formative assessment requires active participation from both learners and lecturers. When learners engage in learning activities, they better understand and retain knowledge. Improvements in learner performance are achieved through supportive feedback from various assessment tasks, including mid-term assessments. Because of its value for learning, formative assessment is also known as assessment for learning.
5. **Summative assessment** is used to evaluate learner achievement at the end of a course or teaching period to measure attainment of the announced outcomes. Since it takes place after the course has ended, summative assessment does not provide opportunities for learners to improve their learning. It therefore measures the level of attainment of learning outcomes quantitatively in the form of scores and is also called assessment of learning outcomes.
6. **Authentic assessment** evaluates learner competence through tasks, situations, and products that reflect real work or life, instead of relying solely on theoretical examinations. Authentic assessment measures learners’ abilities to apply knowledge and skills, encouraging analytical, synthetic, and creative thinking in complex situations.
7. A **marking scheme** refers to the methods of scoring. The term may take different forms depending on the context, such as marking guides, marking criteria, or marking matrices.
8. A **marking guide or answer key** provides instructions for lecturers to grade learners’ tests. Construction of marking guides and scoring rubrics must satisfy scientific and content accuracy requirements while being specific, concise, and easy to follow. For tests with theoretical questions and definite answers, lecturers may prepare straightforward answer keys. For tests and authentic assessments, lecturers must prepare detailed marking rubrics.
9. A **rubric** (marking criteria) is a tool that lists the criteria on which points can be awarded and the expectations for the task that learners must perform. A rubric presents a set of criteria outlining the important components of the activity being assessed. Each rubric describes levels of quality for every criterion. These levels can be expressed as descriptors (for example: Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement) or numerical scores (for example: 4, 3, 2, 1), or both. A rubric is usually structured as a matrix comprising two main components: criteria and descriptors. When constructing a rubric, the most important assessment criteria aligned with the learning outcomes of the course should be selected. The criteria will differ depending on the outcomes of each course. When used effectively, rubrics: (i) provide timely and detailed feedback to learners; (ii) encourage critical thinking and self-assessment; (iii) communicate course expectations; (iv) present the component skills required by each task; and (v) promote fair and consistent grading. Examples of rubrics for various assignments are provided in Appendix 1.

**Article 4. Forms of assessment**

1. Forms of assessment include: oral tests, written tests (paper-based or electronic), multiple-choice tests, practical tests, project or assignment submissions, portfolios, and other forms approved by VJU.
2. Each course must apply at least two forms of assessment, including formative assessment during the course and the end-of-course examination.

**Article 5. Assessment components and weights**

1. Each course must have at least two assessment components, comprising formative assessment during the course and the end-of-course examination. The weighting of these components is specified in the course syllabus (detailed outline).
2. Formative assessment may include class participation, quizzes, presentations, mid-term tests, assignments, or other tasks. Lecturers shall inform learners of the assessment plan at the beginning of the course.
3. The end-of-course examination assesses the overall achievement of the course learning outcomes. Depending on the syllabus, it may take the form of a written exam, oral exam, essay, project, practicum report, or other approved form.

**Article 6. Regulations on using assessment results**

1. Scores for each assessment component are calculated on a 10-point scale rounded to one decimal place, unless otherwise specified by VNU.
2. The overall course grade is calculated according to the weights specified in the syllabus. The final grade is rounded to one decimal place.
3. Assessment results are used for academic standing, graduation eligibility, and other academic decisions according to current regulations.

4. All examination papers must remain sealed during transport and handover. Seals must bear the red stamp of VJU.
5. All papers, originals, and envelopes must be stored in secure, locked cabinets at the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance. The Head of the Office is responsible for supervising confidentiality and duplication procedures.

**Article 14. Examination schedules**

1. Examinations are organised at the end of each semester. The University organises one main examination session and, when feasible, an additional session according to the schedule arranged by the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance. Learners may sit for a course only once in each examination session. If a learner cannot attend for a legitimate reason, they must submit an application for postponement (Appendix 11A) to the Faculty, Program, and functional offices for processing.
2. Examination timetables are published at least two weeks before the first exam date. Changes to the schedule must be notified promptly.
3. Examination rooms must meet the required conditions for seating, lighting, equipment, and surveillance.

Special cases must be reported to the Board of Rectors for consideration.

b. The Office, together with the Office of Planning and Finance, coordinates with the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services and the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance to prepare facilities and open rooms on time. Examination rooms must be clean, have adequate seating, lighting, fans (in summer), and other required conditions. Computer rooms must have IT staff on duty to handle technical issues during the exam.

**Article 17. Assignment of invigilators**

a. Number of invigilators per room:
   - At least two invigilators must be assigned to each room (no more than 15 learners per invigilator).
   - At least one supervisor must be assigned to every five examination rooms in a session.
   - For oral examinations: each room must have at least two staff members (one may be assigned to call candidates in addition to the two examiners). For oral exams with many candidates, multiple interview tables may be set up, but each table must have two lecturers.
   - For computer-based multiple-choice exams: each room must have one IT officer and one invigilator who is a lecturer or specialist of the University.
   - Courses with specific characteristics may assign invigilators and supporting staff according to the Program Director’s proposal approved by the Board of Rectors.

b. Assignment procedures:
   - The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance issues a written request to Faculties and functional offices to nominate invigilators no later than 18 working days before the examination session.
   - Faculties and functional offices nominate invigilators in response to the request and submit the list no later than 10 working days before the examination session. If a Faculty cannot meet the required number, it must send a written request no later than seven days before the exam so the Office can mobilise support from other units.
   - No later than five working days before the examination session, the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance circulates the official assignment list to Faculties and functional offices for implementation.
   - Invigilator assignments to specific rooms are made by drawing lots, while ensuring that lecturers do not invigilate classes they teach, to maintain transparency and fairness.

**Article 18. Handover of examination papers, invigilation, and collection of scripts**

1. Handover of examination papers:
   a. Examination papers, answer booklets, and attendance lists are handed over at the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance or designated examination rooms. Sealed envelopes are released to invigilators no earlier than 30 minutes before the exam starts.
   b. When handing over papers, all parties must check confidentiality, verify seals and signatures, confirm course names, classes, and quantities against the attendance lists and schedule, and sign the handover log.
2. Invigilation:
   a. At the start of the exam, invigilators call learners into the room according to the attendance list or candidate numbers, check student cards (or VJU-issued learner cards or national ID), inspect permitted items, and guide learners to their seats. Impersonation or proxy testing is strictly prohibited. If a learner lacks identification, they must provide a written undertaking certified by another learner in the same class present in the room, who bears responsibility for the information. Detailed duties are specified in Appendix 6.
   b. Invigilators must not permit ineligible learners to sit the exam or add names to attendance lists, except when authorised in writing or verbally by the Head of the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services after consultation with the Head of the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance.
   c. If a learner violates examination rules, invigilators must prepare a record in accordance with Clause 2, Article 23 of these Regulations.
3. Collection of scripts:
   a. Invigilators verify the number of scripts against the attendance list (see Appendix 6 for procedures).
   b. Immediately after each session, invigilators submit exam scripts and envelopes to the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance and sign the receipt log (see Appendix 6).

**Article 19. Organising grading**

1. The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance requests Deans/Program Directors to nominate graders no later than 15 working days before the examination session.
2. Deans/Program Directors assign lecturers to grade each course, ensuring that at least two lecturers grade each course (see assignment template in Appendix 7b). Grading must be conducted seriously, objectively, accurately, and fairly.
3. Grading procedures and submission of scores:
   a. Paper-based grading (essays, combined exams, paper-based multiple-choice):
      - The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance prepares grading rooms and monitors progress.
      - One day after the exam, assigned lecturers may collect scripts at the Office. Graders must submit marked scripts and grade sheets within two weeks (10 working days) of the exam date.
      - Grading must follow the official answer keys and rubrics submitted to the Office. Graders mark directly on the scripts using the 10-point scale rounded to one decimal. Scripts must bear the signatures of both graders. Errors must be reported with a written request stating the reason for adjustment.
   b. Computer-based grading:
      - For exams graded directly on computers: after the test ends, learners stop working and remain seated while invigilators record the scores displayed on screen onto the grade sheet. Learners check and sign the grade sheet. Invigilators are responsible for score accuracy. Grade sheets are made in triplicate: the original for the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance, one copy for the Faculty, and one for the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services.
      - For exams not graded on-site: invigilators must save each learner’s submission on a CD or USB immediately after each session. At the end of the session, invigilators hand over the attendance list and storage media to the Office, which then delivers them to graders as regulated.
      - Grading must follow official answer keys and rubrics. Graders mark on grading sheets and return the storage media, grading sheets, and score sheets to the Office within two weeks (10 working days) of the exam date.
   c. Presentations and essays: grading must follow the approved answer keys and rubrics. Graders record scores on grading sheets and submit the sheets, assignments, and score sheets to the Office within two weeks (10 working days).
   d. Oral examinations: grading must follow the approved answer keys and rubrics. If oral exams are not recorded, scores must be announced to learners immediately after the session and submitted to the Office no later than one working day after the exam.
4. Handling grading discrepancies:
   a. If two grading rounds yield the same result, both graders record the final score for each question and the overall score in both numerals and words. If the overall score matches but component scores differ, graders review the script together to agree on the component scores.
   b. If there is a discrepancy between the two graders:

      | Situation | Handling method |
      | :--- | :--- |
      | Difference in overall or component scores (excluding arithmetic errors) under 1.0 point | Graders discuss and agree on the score, record it, print their full names, and sign every page of the script. |
      | Difference in overall or component scores (excluding arithmetic errors) of 1.0 point or more | Graders discuss and report to the Program Director for agreement (without altering component scores on the script). If they cannot reach agreement, the Dean/Program Director appoints a third grader, who marks the script in a different colour. The official score is the average of the three graders. All graders sign and print their names on every page of the script. |

5. Special cases in grading:
   a. Scripts showing irregularities must be graded collectively. If graders have grounds to conclude that a learner deliberately marked their script, 50% of the total score shall be deducted.
   b. When identical essay scripts are detected, graders handle the case according to Point b, Clause 2, Article 23.
   c. Scripts written on scrap paper or non-standard paper; scripts written in two ink colours; scripts lacking both invigilators’ signatures; scripts written in pencil; scripts written in red ink (except diagrams drawn in pencil as required); scripts containing irrelevant content; crumpled scripts; scripts without the learner’s name and ID shall be recorded by both invigilators and given a score of zero.
   d. If changes to marking schemes or answer keys are required, graders report to the Program Director to prepare minutes stating the reasons and proposed changes. The Dean/Program Director and subject group draft the new rubric and answer key, which must be approved by the Dean/Program Director before grading. The minutes, new answer key, and rubric are filed with the exam papers, and one set is sent to the Office before grading for archiving.
6. Organising grading for graduation theses:
   a. The Rector establishes thesis examination boards. The boards, together with the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services and the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance, implement the current thesis guidelines.
   b. Grading of internship reports, graduation theses/projects, and master’s theses follows the University’s guidelines on thesis implementation.

**Article 20. Re-marking of end-of-course examinations**

1. The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance announces the period for receiving re-marking applications on the same day that overall exam results are published. Applications are accepted for no more than five working days.
2. Learners who have concerns about their scores may submit a re-marking application (see Appendix 8b) to the Office within the announced timeframe.
3. For oral exams or thesis defences, learners must raise concerns immediately after scores are announced. Later complaints are invalid. When a learner questions the score, both graders confer on the learner’s performance and provide a clear, public explanation of whether and why the score is adjusted.
4. Within two days after the application period closes, the Office withdraws the scripts for re-marking and notifies the training units. The Dean/Program Director assigns graders and organises re-marking within seven working days. General courses follow VNU regulations.
5. Handling re-marking results:
   a. Re-marking follows the same procedures as the initial grading.
   b. If the re-marked score differs from the original score by 0.5 to under 1.0 point, the score is adjusted immediately.
   c. If the difference is 1.0 point or more, the Dean/Program Director assigns a different grader from the first round and organises a direct discussion between the first and second graders to agree on the re-marked score and record minutes.
   d. If any party detects intentional violations during processing, the case must be reported to the Inspectorate–Legal Affairs Division for handling.
6. The Office of Testing and Quality Assurance processes re-marking results and forwards them to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services within three working days after re-marking for notification to learners.

**Article 21. Responsibilities of invigilators**

1. Perform invigilation duties as assigned by the Faculty, Program, and Office of Testing and Quality Assurance. Invigilators who are unexpectedly unavailable must notify the Office and their unit at least one day in advance so that replacements can be arranged. Absences without legitimate reasons are the invigilator’s responsibility.
2. Study and strictly comply with examination regulations.
3. Do not invigilate in rooms where relatives (spouse, child, sibling) are sitting the exam.
4. Arrive on time and remain in the examination room throughout the session, carrying out tasks according to the procedures in Appendix 6.
5. Do not engage in personal activities (reading, using mobile phones, smoking, drinking alcohol, etc.) while on duty.
6. Do not assist learners in any form during the examination.
7. Supervisors must monitor compliance by invigilators and learners, record observations in the supervision log, and report after each session. Irregular situations outside their authority must be reported immediately to the Board of Rectors for resolution.

**Article 22. Responsibilities of learners taking examinations**

1. Arrive at the examination room at least 15 minutes before the start time to complete procedures. For essay or paper-based multiple-choice exams, learners arriving more than 15 minutes after papers are opened are not permitted to sit the exam. For oral, practicum, or computer-based exams, if a learner is absent when called but later arrives with a legitimate reason during the session, the invigilator may allow them to sit the exam.
2. Present the VJU-issued student card (or learner card). If lost or forgotten, present the national ID or a confirmation letter bearing the University’s seal for verification.
   *If all identification documents are lost, the learner must submit an undertaking certified by another learner in the same class (see Appendix 9). Special cases must be referred to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services.*
3. Sit in the assigned seat and place identification documents on the desk for inspection.
4. Only bring pens, pencils, compasses, erasers, rulers, calculators without memory or text-editing functions.
5. Do not bring materials into the room (unless authorised in advance for open-book exams); do not bring mobile phones, recording or transmitting devices, storage devices, weapons, explosives, flammable substances, alcohol, carbon paper, or correction pens; smoking is prohibited. For open-book exams, only printed or handwritten materials within the permitted scope may be used.
6. Before starting, write the candidate number and paper code on the answer booklet and request signatures from both invigilators.
7. Write legibly on clean paper without folds or markings. The use of two ink colours, red ink, or pencils is prohibited (except for diagrams where pencils are allowed or when otherwise instructed). Mistakes must be crossed out with a ruler; correction fluid is not allowed. Protect scripts and strictly avoid cheating, viewing others’ scripts, or exchanging materials.
8. Maintain order and silence. Questions must be asked publicly. Inform invigilators immediately in case of sudden illness.
9. Learners may leave the room only after two-thirds of the examination time has elapsed.
10. When time is up, stop writing and submit the script. Even if no answers are written, the answer booklet must be submitted. Learners record the number of pages submitted and sign the attendance list.
11. Learners absent for legitimate reasons such as illness or special circumstances must submit an application for postponement (Appendix 11B) endorsed by the Faculty and sent to the Office. Approved absences allow learners to retain component scores and register for subsequent exam sessions. Three days before the make-up exam, learners must submit the prior approval and new application so the Office can add them to the list.

**Article 23. Handling violations by staff and learners**

1. Handling of staff and lecturers:
   Staff and lecturers involved in examination sessions who violate regulations (detected during or after duty) will be disciplined depending on severity:
   a. Reprimand, applied when committing one of the following:
      - Arriving late.
      - Failing to sign learners’ answer booklets or scrap paper.
      - Failing to concentrate while invigilating.
      - Missing one invigilation session without a legitimate reason.
   b. Warning, applied when committing one of the following:
      - Missing two or more sessions without legitimate reasons in an academic year.
      - Leaving the room for other business during invigilation.
      - Allowing learners to cheat or use unauthorised materials.
      - Failing to record detected violations.
      - Losing examination scripts.
      - Making multiple errors in grading or total scores.
   c. Demotion or dismissal, applied when committing one of the following:
      - Leaking examination papers.
      - Delivering examination papers outside or bringing solutions into the room, or assisting learners during the exam.
      - Cheating during grading; awarding scores contrary to the answer key or intentionally inflating or lowering scores.
      - Altering or adding to learners’ scripts to change scores.
      - Swapping scripts or scores.
2. Handling of learners:
   Learners violating the provisions of Article 22 are recorded and disciplined depending on severity. Invigilators must record the proposed disciplinary form in the report and in the “Notes” column of the attendance list. Reports are attached to the scripts. After the examination, the Office compiles a list of violators and sends it to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services to consider conduct scores.
   a. Reprimand: applied for first-time violations of the following, resulting in a 25% deduction from the examination score:
      - Looking at or exchanging scripts.
      - Talking, disturbing order, or sitting in the wrong seat.
      - Failing to submit the script on time or moving around without permission.
   b. Warning: applied for the following, resulting in a 50% deduction from the examination score:
      - Repeating violations after a reprimand in the same exam.
      - Exchanging scripts or scrap paper.
      - Copying another learner’s work. Identical scripts are handled identically. If the learner can prove they were copied from, the Board may reduce the penalty.
   c. Suspension from the exam: applied for the following, with an immediate expulsion from the room and a score of zero:
      - Repeating violations after a warning in the same exam.
      - Bringing materials into the room.
      - Bringing mobile phones, recording or transmitting devices, storage devices, weapons, explosives, or other dangerous objects.
      - Delivering papers outside the exam area or receiving solutions from outside.
      - Writing or drawing irrelevant content, tearing scripts.
      - Fighting or threatening responsible staff or other learners.
   d. Suspension from study for one year: applied for the following, with immediate removal from the exam room:
      - Sitting exams on behalf of someone else or asking another person to sit the exam for the first offence.
      - Sabotaging the exam or assaulting responsible staff or other learners.
   e. Expulsion: applied for a second offence under Point d. The disciplinary council proposes this penalty to the Rector for decision.
3. Disciplinary decisions must be communicated to learners. If a learner refuses to sign the record, two invigilators and one learner witness sign it. The record is submitted to the Office (see template in Appendix 10).
4. If invigilators fail to prepare records for violations, supervisors or inspectors shall prepare records according to the regulations on inspection of examinations issued by the Ministry of Education and Training and VNU.

**Article 15. Determining examination eligibility**

1. Eligibility for end-of-course examinations:
   a. Undergraduate programs: Learners may sit the end-of-course examination only if the average score of formative assessments (regular tests, mid-terms) is above 0, tuition fees are fully paid, and other conditions specified in the course syllabus are satisfied.

   c. The course coordinator announces the examination requirements to the class during the last lecture or tutorial session. The list of ineligible learners must be submitted by the course coordinator to the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance no later than one working day after the course concludes.
   d. No later than seven working days before the examination, based on the list of learners in arrears provided by the Office of Planning and Finance and the list of ineligible learners provided by lecturers, the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance prepares the examination list with notes on outstanding tuition fees.
   e. Learners who have not paid tuition fees on time may be allowed to sit the exam if, before the exam, they present confirmation of payment issued by the Office of Planning and Finance.
2. Learners may retain course results and sit in subsequent examination sessions when one of the following dossiers is submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs and Student Services:
   a. Medical certificate from a competent authority (with official seal) issued before the examination session.
   b. Documentation proving the death of an immediate family member (father, mother, sibling) within three days before the examination.
   c. Other force majeure circumstances, such as natural disasters, as decided by the Board of Rectors.
3. Changing examination sessions: If multiple sessions are organised for a course and a learner wishes to switch sessions for legitimate reasons, the learner must submit an application endorsed by the Dean/Program Director to the Office of Testing and Quality Assurance at least three working days before the examination.
