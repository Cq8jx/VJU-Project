**[Appendix 2.3:]{.underline} Sample guide for arranging reference
documents**

**- Note:** The following instructions are optimal in case of reference
documents in many different languages. Depending on the specifics of the
training industry, other suitable arrangements may be used.

**GUIDE TO REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION**

1\. Reference documents are arranged separately by language (Vietnamese,
English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc.). Documents in
foreign languages must be kept in their original form, not transcribed
or translated, including documents in Chinese, Japanese, etc. (For
documents in languages that are not yet widely known, a Vietnamese
translation can be added to each document).

2\. References are arranged in alphabetical order by author's name
according to each country's practice:

- Foreign authors are listed in alphabetical order by last name:

> + There is one author (according to example document number 28);
>
> + There are two authors (according to example document number 29);
>
> + There are three or more authors: from the second author onwards,
> the first name is abbreviated first, then the last name. The authors'
> names are separated by a comma. Before the last author's first name
> and last name, replace the comma with \"and\" (according to example
> document number 30).

- The author is Vietnamese: arrange in alphabetical order by name but
  keep the usual order of Vietnamese names, do not put the given name
  before the last name.

- Documents without author names are arranged in alphabetical order from
  the beginning of the name of the agency issuing the report or
  publication, for example: General Statistics Office arranged in
  alphabetical order T, Ministry of Education and Training arranged in
  alphabetical order B, etc.

3\. Reference documents such as books, theses, dissertations, and
reports must include the following information:

- Author or publishing agency name (no separator).

- (year of publication), (in parentheses, comma after parentheses).

- *Title of book, thesis or report* ( italicized, comma at end of
  title).

- publisher, (comma at the end of the publisher's name).

- Place of publication. (period ends reference).

(see example documents no. 2, 3, 4, 23, 31, 33, 34, 35).

References are articles in magazines, articles in books, etc. that
include the following information:

- author name (no separator)

- (year of publication), (in parentheses, comma after parentheses)

- "title of article", (in quotation marks, not italicized, comma at the
  end of the name)

- *Magazine or book title* ( italicized, comma at the end of the name)

- set (no separator)

- (number), (in parentheses, comma after parentheses)

- Page numbers. (dash between two digits, period at end)

(see example documents no. 1, 28, 29, 32).

Pay attention to the above presentation details. If the document is
longer than one line, the second line should be indented 1cm from the
first line so that the reference is clear and easy to follow.

**ABSTRACT**

Nowadays, water pollution caused by arsenic is social issues of concern.
The removal of arsenic and ammonium ions in water is essential and
urgent. Therefore this thesis studied the preparation of nano titanium
dioxide coated on activated carbon- a good adsorbent for the removal of
arsenic water environment. Starting materials for the preparation of
nano titanium dioxide coated on activated carbon(AC-TiO ~2~ ) are nano
titanium dioxide solution of 400 ppm synthesized by neutralizing TiCl
~4~ /HCl by diluted ammonia solution to pH = 6-7, and rinse activated
carbon with the nano titanium dioxide solutions for 4 hours. The most
important factor affecting the efficiency of synthesize process is the
rate of TiCl ~4~ /HCl neutralization and the concentration of nano
titanium dioxide solution. The optimal concentration of nano titanium
dioxide solution is 400 ppm. The resulting product was washed by
distilled water to remove chloride ions and dehydrated at 80 ^o^ C for
24 hours to converse TiO(OH) ~2~ to TiO ~2~ . Experiments were conducted
to investigate the adsorption capacity of AC-TiO ~2~ for arsenic removal
in water: such as determining optimal pH, adsorption equilibrium time,
maximum adsorption capacity and influence of interference ions on
adsorption capacity. Results show that arsenic is adsorbed onto the
surface of AC-TiO ~2~ best at near-neutral pH (pH 6-7). Time to reach
adsorption equilibrium of AC-TiO ~2~ with arsenic is 5-6 hours minutes
with arsenic. Maximum adsorption capacity of AC-TiO ~2~ with arsenic,
ammonium is 12.51 mg/g and it obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

**Keywords:** nano-titanium dioxide coated on activated carbon,
adsorption, adsorption capacity.

**THINGS TO NOTE**

In order to improve the quality of students' graduation thesis, during
the implementation process, students keep a graduation thesis/project
diary. Students need to note and follow the following instructions:

1\. KL, DA diary is printed in A5 size including: 01 hard cover page
(printed in color), 01 additional cover page (printed in black and
white), 01 page clearly stating:

" *I confirm that the information I provide in my Thesis/Graduate
Project Diary is true and correct.*

*....., date month year 202...*

> *Student*
>
> *(Sign and print full name)"*

2\. The KL, DA diary is a type of notebook that records the developments
in the process of implementing KL, DA of students, with the main
contents:

\- Record specific working sessions with the instructor, including:
date, month, year, content of discussion, feedback and confirmation from
the instructor and student. In case of discussion via email or other
methods, it must also be shown in the Diary, with confirmation from the
instructor and student.

\- At the same time, the student's KL and DA Diary also clearly shows
the amount of work the instructor does for that student, which serves as
the basis for calculating the instructor's guidance fee.

3\. The KL and DA diary is also important evidence for the KL and DA
implementation process of students and is a condition for students to
submit KL and DA.

Upon completing the thesis, the MA and ensuring all other conditions for
defense, the student must submit an application for the thesis defense
with the consent of the supervisor; and at the same time, send all
documents to the Faculty.

4\. Lecturers and students must strictly comply with this regulation of
the School.
