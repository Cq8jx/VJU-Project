dated April 20, 2020 of the President of VNU on practical internship and
internship topics for full-time undergraduate students at VNU;

Vietnam-Japan University guides the Faculties to conduct practical
internships and internship topics for full-time students as follows:

### 1. Scope of regulation and applicable subjects

- This guideline provides for the implementation of practical internship
  activities, reporting and evaluation of practical internship
  activities.
- This guide applies to students and lecturers of training programs
  (CTĐT) at Vietnam-Japan University.

### 12. Principles for ensuring the quality and effectiveness of internship activities

- Meet the output standards of the training program through practical
  experience activities.
- Encourage students' autonomy and creativity, increasing employment
  opportunities while studying and after graduation.
- Provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their abilities,
  analyze and evaluate work, enhance self-confidence, personal
  orientation and establish social skills.
- To help students become familiar with organizations, social awareness
  and intercultural communication skills in a multicultural environment.
- Innovate teaching methods, combine training between schools and
  internship facilities to improve adaptability and employability.

### 12. About the practical internship training program

- The practical internship component is mandatory in the training
  program framework. Students must undergo at least one semester
  combining classroom learning with practical activities and internships
  at the internship facility.
- Practical and internship activities are carried out continuously and
  flexibly throughout the students' training process at school.
- Internship activities are carried out flexibly in terms of time, in
  which the total internship time and study time do not exceed the
  maximum total time of the course according to current training
  regulations.
- Organizing practical internships for students must be done
  systematically, with close coordination and connection between
  training units and practice and internship facilities.
- Internship and practice activities can be deployed on the basis of
  applying advanced technology, simulation in the laboratory, and field
  trips.
- Training programs in economics, law, education, foreign languages,
  social sciences and humanities must have a practical internship
  component at internship facilities.
- Training programs in natural sciences, technology - engineering,
  health and life sciences must have practical internship components in
  laboratories, workshops, factories, enterprises, hospitals and
  centers.
- The time for practical training is converted into the same time as the
  time for laboratory training. One credit hour of practical training is
  equivalent to 3-6 internship periods at the facility. To receive 1
  credit hour of practical training, students must spend at least 2
  periods of personal preparation.
- Students can do internships multiple times during the entire course,
  but must ensure that the minimum assessed time is 30 working days or
  more during the entire course, at times suitable to their personal
  schedule and the needs of the receiving unit (or individual).

### 4. Requirements for internship facilities

  enterprises, corporations, socio-political organizations, schools,
  research institutes, and other internship facilities related to the

  or those with educational and training functions) to ensure the
  physical, life and mental safety of students.

  training content, knowledge and development of professional skills and
  necessary supplementary skills for students to complete the training
  program output standards.

  practical internship activities.
