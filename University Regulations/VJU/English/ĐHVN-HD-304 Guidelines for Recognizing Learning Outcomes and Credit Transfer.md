Vietnam-Japan University (VJU) guides students on the implementation of
recognition of learning outcomes and credit transfer for students of
university training programs (CTĐT) of VJU as follows:

## I. Applicable subjects:

Students of university training programs of Vietnam National University.

## II. Principles for considering recognition of learning outcomes and credit transfer

1.  The credits that students have accumulated will be considered for
    recognition and credit conversion based on comparison of output
    standards, content and volume of study, methods of course assessment
    and quality assurance conditions.
2.  Foreign language certificates and diplomas recognized by VNU
    (according to the list officially announced in the University\'s
    annual announcements) will be converted into credits of foreign
    language courses in the training program.
3.  A student\'s scientific research work can be converted to replace a
    conditional elective course in the field of knowledge. Conversion is
    only applied when the work has been evaluated and scored on a
    10-point scale by the Professional Council, ensuring that it meets
    the criteria of quality and applicability based on comparison with
    the content of the corresponding course and the output standards of
    the training program. Contents related to students\' scientific
    research achievements refer to Article 29, University Training
    Regulations 5115 or Article 32, University Training Regulations 3626
    at Hanoi National University.
4.  For students who change majors, majors, training programs, or study
    two training programs at the same time: The Department of Training &
    Student Affairs (DT&CTSV) will recognize learning outcomes and
    transfer credits according to the issued List of Equivalent Courses.
5.  Credit recognition and transfer limits:

- The total number of recognized credits shall not exceed 50% of the
  minimum study load of the training program.
- In student exchange, credits accumulated at facilities outside of
  Vietnam National University, Hanoi do not exceed 25% of the total
  volume of the training program.

## III. Procedures for recognizing learning outcomes and credit transfer

1.  Students submit an application for recognition of academic results
    and credit transfer including an application and supporting evidence
    (notarized copy of transcript, foreign language
    certificate/certificate).
2.  The VNU\'s professional council will review the results to recognize
    learning outcomes and transfer credits for the courses that students
    accumulate in the training program based on the principles stated in
    this Guide, complete and send the approved documents to the
    Department of Training and Student Affairs.
3.  After the application is approved by the Board of Directors, the
    Student Affairs Department will enter the converted scores for
    students into the learning management system of VNU.

## IV. Implementation

This instruction is effective from the date of signing. During the
implementation process, if any problems arise, units and individuals
shall report to the Board of Directors (through the Training and Student
Affairs Department) for timely handling.
