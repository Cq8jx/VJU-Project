# University Regulations Archive

This directory organizes regulatory documents relevant to VJU operations. Materials are grouped by issuing body to make it easier to locate applicable policies and procedural guidance.

## Structure

- **MOET** – Circulars from Vietnam's Ministry of Education and Training that govern national admission, training, and curriculum standards for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs. Key documents include the 2021 circulars on undergraduate training (`BGDĐT-TT-08-2021`), master's admissions and training (`BGDĐT-TT-23-2021`), and doctoral admissions and training (`BGDĐT-TT-18-2021`), each available in Vietnamese, English, and Japanese translations alongside the official PDFs.
- **VNU** – Decisions issued by Vietnam National University, Hanoi that define university-wide regulations such as the 2022 undergraduate training framework (`ĐHQGHN-QĐ-3626`), master's training regulations (`ĐHQGHN-QĐ-3636`), doctoral training regulations (`ĐHQGHN-QĐ-3638`), and diploma management policies (`ĐHQGHN-QĐ-4455`). Documents are provided in Vietnamese originals, English translations, and Japanese translations when available, plus the promulgating decision PDFs.
- **VJU** – Vietnam Japan University guidance notes, notices, and templates that supplement national and VNU regulations. These include instructions on foreign language certificate submissions (`ĐHVN-TB-984`, `ĐHVN-TB-1010`, `ĐHVN-TB-911`), thesis and graduation project organization (`ĐHVN-HD-1534`), internship guidance (`ĐHVN-HD-483`), academic advising regulations (`ĐHVN-QĐ-473`), and forms such as JLPT authorization letters and annex templates in both Vietnamese and English. The `Original` subdirectory stores the authoritative PDFs and editable `.docx` templates together for quick access while language-specific folders provide translations and localized guidance.

## Usage tips

- Use the Vietnamese filenames (prefixed with `ĐHQGHN` or `BGDĐT`) to cross-reference official decision or circular numbers.
- When working with bilingual resources, refer to the English or Japanese Markdown summaries for quick reference before consulting the authoritative PDF.
- Templates and appendices in the VJU subfolder are provided in editable formats (`.docx`) and supporting PDFs to streamline administrative workflows.
