# University Regulations Archive

This directory organizes regulatory documents relevant to VJU operations. Materials are now grouped by language so that the desired working copy can be opened directly, regardless of issuing body.

## Structure

- **English/** – English translations and guidance notes for MOET circulars, VNU decisions, and VJU procedures. Typical examples include `BGDDT-TT-23-2021 Regulations on Master's Degree Enrollment and Training.md` and `DHVN-HD-483 Guidelines for Practical Internships and Internship Topics.md`.
- **Japanese/** – Japanese localizations used for faculty and administrative reference. Files retain official numbering (e.g., `DHQGHN-QD-3626 学部教育に関する規則.md`, `DHVN-TB-911 外国語証明書提出通知 VJU2024.md`).
- **Vietnamese/** – Vietnamese originals or OCR-converted texts (`*_source.md`). These mirror the wording of promulgated decisions and circulars, preserving diacritics and official terminology.
- **Source/** – Authoritative PDFs, DOC/DOCX templates, and other non-Markdown assets. File names align with the corresponding Markdown so each bundle stays together.

## Usage tips

- Use the Vietnamese filenames (prefixed with `ĐHQGHN`, `BGDĐT`, `ĐHVN`, etc.) when cross-referencing decision numbers with official gazettes.
- For bilingual work, start with the English or Japanese Markdown files, then consult the matching PDF in `Source/` for the signed original or template.
- When adding new documents, drop Markdown into the appropriate language folder and place supporting PDFs or editable templates into `Source/` to keep the archive consistent.
