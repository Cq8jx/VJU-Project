**5. Summary of the formation and development process of the educational
institution:**

The idea of building a university that acts as a cultural and
educational bridge between Vietnam and Japan was proposed by the
Vietnamese Government at the first Conference of Rectors of Vietnamese
and Japanese Universities in 2009. This proposal received consensus and
strong support from the governments of the two countries. After 5 years
of preparation, in July 2014, the Prime Minister of Vietnam signed
Decision No. 1186/QD-TTg dated July 21, 2014, officially establishing
the Vietnam-Japan University, a member unit of the Vietnam National
University, Hanoi.

To fulfill this mission, VJU has built postgraduate training programs
since its inception, taught entirely in English (except for Philosophy)
with the participation of Vietnamese and Japanese experts. Undergraduate
training programs are built and developed based on the needs of
Vietnamese and Japanese society. VJU's training programs require and
create conditions for all students and trainees to participate in
internship courses in both Vietnam and Japan to help learners accumulate
experience and practical knowledge about the profession. In addition to
building a project to open training programs, preparing conditions to
ensure the quality of training programs, the school's leadership team
also focuses on building a development strategy for the school. The
Development Strategy of Vietnam-Japan University to 2030, vision to 2035
was issued in 2020. This Strategy declares the mission, vision to 2035,
core values and action slogan of Vietnam-Japan University. The Strategy
also identifies the Strategic Goals to 2025 and vision to 2035.

In 2020, Vietnam-Japan University had a fundamental change in its
organizational structure and training management mechanism. Before 2020,
training programs were under the direct management of the Board of
Directors. Training activities of each training program were managed by
the Program Director. Since 2020, Vietnam-Japan University has
restructured towards more specialization, establishing the Faculty of
Advanced Technology and Engineering responsible for managing training
programs in the fields of natural sciences and technology and the
Faculty of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences responsible for managing
training programs in the fields of economics and social sciences. The
establishment of the two faculties has gradually solved the problem of
sharing resources between training programs in the University. VJU has
also continuously expanded and improved its learning environment in
recent years, including opening new university training programs to meet
social needs, sending students to study at the QGHN04 area in Hoa Lac,
and is making efforts to complete the project to build the Vietnam-Japan
University in Hoa Lac using ODA loans from the Japanese government.

In 2024, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of VJU, the University
issued the “VJU Future Vision”, defining the goals and directions that
VJU will pursue in the next ten years, closely linking its continuous
efforts and commitments into a roadmap for stronger development and
improvement in the future. The vision forms the foundation for various
activities that VJU is and will carry out to provide a liberal education
and sustainable development. At the same time, the vision contributes to
cultivating in learners the spirit of daring to challenge, high
adaptability, thinking from many aspects and fields, self-study
capacity, leadership capacity, execution, promoting social development
with thinking and tools of digital transformation, green transformation
and good interaction with computers - necessary capacities in society
5.0.

Vietnam - Japan University are summarized in Table 1 below.

| 9   | Percentage of graduates with jobs in their field | 78.79% | 65.52%       |

*\* The data in rows 7 and 8 are updated to June 30, 2025; The
graduation rate is calculated by the number of students graduating from
June 30, 2024 to July 10, 2025 over the total number of students who are
due to graduate but have not yet graduated; The on-time graduation rate
is calculated by the number of students graduating on time and before
the deadline over the total number of students of the VJU2021 and
QHJ2023 courses. The graduation rate is smaller than the on-time
graduation rate due to the high number of graduate students of the
QHJ2022 and QHJ2021 courses.*

*Note: Current student data is calculated up to September 2024; New
recruitment data is calculated as of June 30, 2025; Graduation data is
calculated for students graduating from August 1, 2024 to July 10, 2025;
The employment rate of students 1 year after graduation is calculated
for students graduating from August 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024. The number
of responses from students 1 year after graduation of the Japanese study
program is low, the data will be updated later.*
