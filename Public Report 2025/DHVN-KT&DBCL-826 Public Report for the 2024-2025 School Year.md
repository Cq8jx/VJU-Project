**4.2. Vision:**

Become one of the leading prestigious research universities in Asia in advanced engineering technology and interdisciplinary science serving the goal of sustainable development, leveraging the strengths of both Vietnam and Japan. Strive to become Asia’s leading university in sustainability science.

**5. Summary of the establishment and development of the educational institution:**

The idea of building a university that serves as a cultural and educational bridge between Vietnam and Japan was proposed by the Government of Vietnam at the first Conference of Rectors of Vietnamese and Japanese Universities in 2009. The proposal received consensus and strong support from both governments. After five years of preparation, in July 2014 the Prime Minister of Vietnam signed Decision No. 1186/QĐ-TTg dated 21 July 2014 officially establishing Vietnam-Japan University, a member of Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

To fulfil this mission, VJU has offered postgraduate programmes since its inception, taught entirely in English (except for Philosophy) with the participation of Vietnamese and Japanese experts. Undergraduate programmes are built and developed based on the needs of Vietnamese and Japanese society. VJU’s programmes require and enable all students and learners to join internships in both Vietnam and Japan so that learners can accumulate practical experience and knowledge about their professions. Alongside designing new programmes and preparing quality-assurance conditions, the leadership team has focused on developing the University’s strategy. The Development Strategy of Vietnam-Japan University to 2030, with a vision to 2035, was issued in 2020. The Strategy affirms the mission, the vision to 2035, core values, and the action motto of Vietnam-Japan University, and identifies the strategic goals to 2025 with a vision to 2035.

In 2020, Vietnam-Japan University fundamentally changed its organisational structure and training-management mechanism. Before 2020, programmes were directly managed by the Board of Rectors, and each programme’s operations were led by its director. Since 2020, VJU has restructured for greater specialisation by establishing the Faculty of Advanced Technologies and Engineering to manage programmes in natural sciences and technology, and the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences to manage programmes in economics and social sciences. The two faculties have gradually resolved resource-sharing issues among programmes. VJU has also continued to expand and improve the learning environment in recent years, including launching new undergraduate programmes to meet social needs, moving students to study at the QGHN04 area in Hoa Lac, and working to complete the project to build the Hoa Lac campus with ODA loans from the Government of Japan.

In 2024, on the occasion of VJU’s 10th anniversary, the University announced the “VJU Future Vision”, setting out the goals and directions the University will pursue over the next decade and linking its continuous efforts and commitments into a roadmap for stronger future development. The vision forms the foundation for the activities that VJU is and will be implementing to deliver liberal education and sustainable development. At the same time, it helps cultivate in learners a spirit of taking on challenges, high adaptability, multidisciplinary thinking, self-learning capacity, leadership and execution capabilities, and the ability to promote social development with the mindsets and tools of digital and green transformation as well as effective interaction with computers—competencies necessary in Society 5.0.

Major milestones in the history of Vietnam-Japan University are summarised in Table 1.

*Note: Data in rows 7 and 8 are updated to 30 June 2025. The graduation rate is calculated as the number of students graduating from 30 June 2024 to 10 July 2025 over the total number due to graduate but yet to graduate. The on-time graduation rate is calculated for cohorts VJU2021 and QHJ2023 and includes students graduating on time or early. The graduation rate is lower than the on-time rate because many QHJ2022 and QHJ2021 master’s students have not yet graduated.*
