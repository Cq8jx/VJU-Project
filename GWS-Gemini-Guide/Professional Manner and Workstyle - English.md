## Preface: Building Trust as a University Professional

Academic and General Affairs offices connect students, faculty, and external stakeholders. Daily duties include curriculum coordination, student-record management, facility upkeep, training programmes, and budget execution. In a global campus environment, **professional manner** and **workstyle** underpin credibility as much as technical know-how. In student services, faculty meetings, and interactions with government or industry, staff are consistently evaluated on whether they:

- Maintain a neat, trustworthy presence at the counter and online
- Share information accurately while explaining the background of changes
- Respect institutional procedures and show courtesy to all parties
- Honour deadlines, report progress, and surface risks proactively
- Sustain service quality even during hybrid work or peak seasons

This guide applies the internationally recognised framework of Appearance, Communication, Etiquette & Protocol, Time Management, and adds **continuous workstyle improvement**. Case studies and exercises help readers translate ideas into action.

## Chapter 1: Core Guidelines and Practices

### Section 1: International Framework Overview

| Domain | Purpose | Key Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Appearance | Keep first impressions and trust | Clean counter presence, TPO, consistent badges |
| Communication | Build relationships and share information | Greeting, listening, questioning, keep in touch, 24-hour replies, accountability |
| Etiquette & Protocol | Establish order and courtesy | Business cards, seating, honorifics, reception, administrative procedures |
| Time Management | Respect time and produce results | Timetable coordination, deadline control, back-planning, early alerts |
| Workstyle | Optimise operations | Hybrid scheduling, focus blocks, rotations, performance dashboards |

### Section 2: Appearance – Designing a Trustworthy Presence

#### 2-1. First Impressions as a “Filter of Trust”
- Impressions form in seconds and influence later evaluations.
- Balance attire, hair, footwear, accessories, and posture.

#### 2-2. Dressing by TPO
1. **Time** (season/peak): admissions briefings, registration periods, parent meetings.
2. **Place**: counter, faculty rooms, online consultations, public offices.
3. **Occasion**: sector conventions, stakeholder relationships, ceremonial formality.

#### 2-3. Appearance Self-check
- Are hair and nails tidy?
- Any wrinkles, loose threads, or stains?
- Is the badge positioned properly?
- Is webcam framing and lighting clear?

#### Case Example
At a parent briefing, casual attire led to feedback that “the university feels unreliable.” Standardising jackets and badge placement raised satisfaction scores the next year.

### Section 3: Communication – Cultivating Trust through Dialogue

#### 3-1. Fundamentals
- **Greeting**: Always greet, call names, and never change courtesy by nationality or rank.
- **Listening**: Use eye contact, nodding, note-taking.
- **Questioning**: Prepare questions to show interest; restate respect during long exchanges.
- **Keep in touch**: Close conversations or emails with a phrase signalling ongoing commitment.
- **Anticipation**: Plan messages with the recipient’s likely reactions in mind, attach clarifications or data in advance, and reduce avoidable back-and-forth.

#### 3-2. Email and Messaging Rules
1. **Reply within 24 hours** and acknowledge even when checking details.
2. **Share potential delays early** with revised timelines.
3. **Follow up after a week of silence**—confirm the counterpart’s status or explain your own delay.
4. **State preferences when scheduling** to reduce back-and-forth and save time (e.g., “Monday 10:00 or Tuesday 15:00 works; Monday morning is preferable”).
5. Tag subject lines (e.g., [Urgent], [Completed]) and bullet key points/attachments.
6. **Send reminders one to two days before deadlines** so others can respond comfortably.
7. **Select channels purposefully**: phone/chat for urgent confirmations, email for documented requests, SNS/bulletin boards for community updates.
8. **Send same-day thank-you notes** after meetings, summarising next steps for all stakeholders.
9. **Draft for faster decisions**: When appropriate, prepare draft approvals or briefing notes—even if a supervisor will own the final version—to accelerate decisions and free their time.

#### 3-3. Non-verbal & Leadership Communication
- Camera angle, background, lighting matter online.
- Nods and expressions aid mutual understanding.
- Managers must stay composed; impatience or visible frustration discourages reporting and slows collaboration.

#### Case Example
A prompt thank-you email to an external partner, ending with “Keep in touch,” led to smoother joint event planning the following year.

### Section 4: Etiquette & Protocol – Creating Order and Courtesy

#### 4-1. Essentials When Hosting or Visiting
1. Introduce affiliation, role, purpose at reception.
2. Walk half a step behind hosts, keep materials accessible.
3. Join online meetings 10 minutes early to test equipment.
4. On departure, express thanks and confirm next deliverables/contact methods.

#### 4-2. Business Cards and Introductions
- Offer cards with both hands below the counterpart’s hands.
- Keep received cards on the table during meetings.
- Confirm preferred contact channels (email, SNS, messaging apps).

#### 4-3. Gifts and Souvenirs
- Check cultural norms on timing and opening behaviour.
- Treat packaging as part of courtesy.

#### Case Example
Prioritising another call during a vendor meeting disrupted discussions; instituting a “no calls while hosting” rule improved satisfaction.

### Section 5: Time Management – Respecting Time and Driving Productivity

#### 5-1. Time as “Visible Respect”
- Aim to arrive/log in five minutes early.
- Submit key documents early to preserve approval buffers.

#### 5-2. Email Response Timing
- Treat 24-hour turnaround as standard; share urgent updates immediately.
- Alert stakeholders early when timetable changes or notices may slip.

#### 5-3. Priorities, Focus, and Error Prevention
- Use the Eisenhower Matrix to classify tasks.
- Block focus time and mute notifications.
- Deploy pre-send checklists to avoid missing attachments or wrong recipients.

#### 5-4. Meeting Design and Facilitation
- **Clarify objectives and outputs**: Specify whether the meeting—executive sessions included—must reach a decision, escalate a risk, or agree on next steps. Share agenda and materials at least 24 hours in advance.
- **Assign roles to protect time**: Separate chair, timekeeper, and note-taker; display timers for each topic. When discussion overruns, park items or route them to a smaller task force instead of extending the meeting indefinitely.
- **Shift information sharing offline**: Circulate summaries or short recordings beforehand so the live meeting focuses on questions, trade-offs, and decisions.
- **Confirm decisions, owners, and deadlines**: Reserve the final five minutes to recap outcomes, open issues, and responsible persons. Distribute minutes the same day and nominate a follow-up contact (e.g., executive assistant) for leadership meetings.
- **Review cadence regularly**: If meetings consistently run long, reassess purpose, attendees, and frequency each quarter; consider redesigning portions as workshops, async updates, or 1-on-1s.

Matrix templates and the five-point email checklist mirror the Japanese edition.

#### Case Example
Submitting the course catalogue early gave IT time to test, enabling a zero-defect release; delays in another year caused late-night publication and student complaints.

### Section 6: Continuous Improvement and Workstyle Enablement

#### 6-1. Process Visualisation and Improvement
- Map schedules/workflows; identify bottlenecks regularly.
- Use weekly/monthly reviews to discuss what to stop/reduce/automate.
- Leverage digital tools to remove duplicate entry and paper processes.
- Base priorities on data (service counts, processing time, inquiry trends) to gain buy-in.
- Pilot, evaluate, and standardise successful ideas.

#### 6-2. Structuring Workstyles
- Share on-site/off-site schedules to avoid duplicated or unattended counters.
- Balance focus and service blocks to preserve capacity for urgent tasks.
- Delegate decision-making/external coordination gradually to reduce bottlenecks and grow talent.
- Address chronic overtime early via workload reallocation or outsourcing.
- Maintain an approachable attitude; impatience discourages consultation.

#### 6-3. Strengthening the Middle-Management Role
- Bridge leadership policies and frontline realities with data-backed reports.
- Visualise workloads/skills, plan rotations and development to avoid over-reliance on individuals.
- Reserve listening time in meetings to channel frontline ideas into decisions.
- Lead the cycle of fact-finding → stakeholder alignment → prevention, and share lessons with the team.

### Section 7: Intercultural Understanding and Application

#### 7-1. Cultural Profiles
(Table for Vietnam, Western, Japan as in Japanese edition.)

#### 7-2. Intercultural Process
(Steps 1–6: self-awareness, observation, information gathering, hypothesis/verification, adjustment, sharing.)

#### 7-3. Commonalities and Differences
- Shared values, key differences, and practical tips for Vietnam, Western contexts, and Japan.

### Section 8: Case Studies and Exercises

1. **Course Guidance with No Questions**
   - Situation: Students remain silent even when invited to ask questions.
   - Exercise: Prepare FAQs and practice prompts that draw out concerns.
   - Answer Example: Compile FAQs on registration deadlines, language placement, and class lotteries; distribute with materials; highlight “frequently asked” items before closing and direct students to individual consultation booths.

2. **Late Arrival to Faculty Coordination Meeting**
   - Situation: You arrive 30 minutes late to a multi-faculty timetable meeting, halting progress.
   - Exercise: Discuss impacts on teaching; draft delay notification and alternative proposal emails.
   - Answer Example: When delay is anticipated, email the chair: “Train delays will make me 10+ minutes late. Materials are in the shared drive; could you discuss Option 1 until I arrive?” Record cause and recovery plan in the minutes upon arrival.

3. **MEXT Online Meeting Etiquette**
   - Situation: You prioritised another chat during a ministry consultation.
   - Exercise: Role-play poor vs. good behaviour and reaffirm protocol.
   - Answer Example: Demonstrate the poor pattern (“camera off, silent typing”), then show best practice (muting notifications, stating “I’ll check that after this call”). Send meeting notes and a thank-you email within five minutes.

4. **Delayed AV Upgrade Project**
   - Situation: Classroom AV upgrades will slip beyond the planned date.
   - Exercise: Prepare messages for internal stakeholders and vendors, plus backup measures.
   - Answer Example: Internal memo: “Room X upgrades shift by 10 days due to supplier delays. Two portable projectors will be available, and online delivery support is ready.” Vendor email: attach a checklist covering delay reasons, new delivery date, and additional tasks.

### Section 9: Behaviour Matrix

| **Stakeholders \ Domain** | **Appearance** | **Communication** | **Etiquette & Protocol** | **Time Management** | **Workstyle** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Students & Faculty** | Maintain a neat appearance and university badge | Greet, listen, question, keep in touch; follow up if silence exceeds a week | Use polite language and handle documents carefully | Reply within 24 hours, send reminders, manage deadlines | Offer visit/online slots, gather feedback for improvement |
| **Internal Departments** | Display unity in meetings | Share transparent feedback, clarify approval flows | Adhere to internal routing procedures | Share updates quickly, adjust schedules promptly | Track KPIs, clarify role sharing, explore automation |
| **External Partners & Government** | Align attire with partner norms | Communicate clearly, share preferences and constraints | Welcome guests, prepare gifts, send thanks | Honour deadlines, schedule reminders, follow up | Visualise joint processes and sustain cooperation |

### Section 10: Action Declarations and Follow-up

1. **Create Quarterly Action Declarations**
   - Each staff member lists three items at the start of the quarter: behaviour to improve, skill to learn, and a measurable indicator.
   - Store the sheet in the shared drive and review brief progress updates during morning huddles or monthly meetings.

2. **Embed Follow-up Loops**
   - Use monthly 1-on-1 sessions to check progress, identify blockers, and adjust goals or resources where needed.
   - In team meetings, summarise successes, key learnings, and unmet goals with next steps so the whole group benefits from the experience.

3. **Run a Mentoring Programme**
   - Pair newcomers or priority talent with experienced mentors; schedule monthly check-ins and provide a day-to-day contact channel.
   - Mentors review process as well as outcomes, recommending training or tools to close gaps.
   - Conduct semi-annual reflections to capture mentoring insights and share them across the team.

## Chapter 2: Middle Management Leadership

### Section 1: Organisational Perspective and Strategic Alignment

Middle managers act as the bridge between institutional strategy and frontline execution. They cannot rely solely on written directives; they must also read the intent behind leadership decisions and translate it into actionable guidance for their teams.

- **Work across time horizons**: Balance past practices, current realities, and the university’s future direction. Use recurring meetings and informal check-ins to confirm what needs to stay, what must evolve, and why.
- **Check institution-wide alignment**: When proposing initiatives, map benefits and side-effects for other departments, faculty, and students. Summarise upsides and risks before discussing them with supervisors.
- **Make reasoning transparent**: Document the logic behind recommendations so the team understands how the decision supports organisational goals. Revisit the purpose if you feel unsure.

#### Action Checklist
- Confirm key updates about strategy or risk at each routine meeting and share them with the team.
- Review proposals from a university-wide perspective and state who will be affected and how.
- When uncertain, escalate with a short brief covering objective, impact, and alternative options.

### Section 2: Building Partnerships with Supervisors

Securing managerial support while earning autonomy is vital. Understand your supervisor’s style, show respect, and still surface honest views grounded in facts.

- **Balance respect with candour**: Back differing opinions with data, timelines, or stakeholder voices so disagreements focus on value, not personalities.
- **Manage upward**: Anticipate likely questions, prepare risk/contingency notes, and clarify what decisions you need from the supervisor. Allow them to focus on areas where their authority or network adds value.
- **Invite support intentionally**: For issues where the supervisor’s experience helps, request their involvement while you handle coordination and follow-through.

#### Action Checklist
- Observe what evidence and formats your supervisor trusts, then tailor reports accordingly.
- Practise sharing at least one alternative or concern each week to normalise open dialogue.
- Frame consultations around “context, analysis, requested support” to build confidence.

### Section 3: Negotiating Interests and Building Consensus

Conflicting expectations among departments, faculty, or committees are common. Middle managers lead the process of surfacing issues, finding common ground, and keeping student and societal perspectives visible.

- **Map issues and interests**: Capture discussion points as questions, risks, and options. Identify missing facts or stakeholders who must be consulted before the next meeting.
- **Shift perspective when stuck**: Introduce student, community, or long-term institutional viewpoints to reset polarised debates.
- **Plan the negotiation flow**: Schedule pre-briefs with key influencers, design meeting agendas that move from shared facts to options, and agree on how decisions will be communicated and implemented.

#### Action Checklist
- Summarise who said what, their rationale, and evidence gaps on a single page to share with stakeholders.
- Clarify carry-over items and immediate next steps at every meeting conclusion.
- If progress stalls, prepare a narrative focused on student or societal impact to reframe the goal.

### Section 4: Designing Teams that Harness Diversity

High-performing teams welcome diverse work styles, contracts, and life stages. Middle managers convert individual strengths into collective capability while providing necessary accommodations.

- **Turn individuality into strength**: Discuss how part-time, contract, and full-time staff can each contribute, and adjust responsibilities to tap their perspectives.
- **Adjust the environment**: Set schedules, meeting times, and handover protocols that respect personal constraints while maintaining service levels.
- **Protect psychological safety**: Model curiosity and appreciation for different viewpoints so members feel safe sharing ideas or concerns.

#### Action Checklist
- Maintain a short profile of each team member’s strengths, constraints, and development goals to guide task assignments.
- Highlight one example per month where diverse viewpoints improved an outcome.
- Confirm accommodations directly with the individual, record agreements, and review them periodically.

### Section 5: Designing and Supporting Capability Development

You are both a learner and a learning designer for your team. Combine on-the-job experiences with structured programmes so skills grow in step with organisational needs.

- **Plan OJT deliberately**: Explain the regulations, policies, and stakeholder expectations behind daily work. Rotate tasks and conduct cross-reviews to avoid single points of failure.
- **Engineer delegation**: Catalogue routine workflows, document procedures and FAQs, and hand responsibilities over in stages so middle managers can focus on coordination and strategic duties while maintaining quality through reviews.
- **Champion Off-JT**: Clarify why specific courses, conferences, or online modules matter. Set expectations for takeaways before staff attend.
- **Link learning loops**: Connect Off-JT insights with OJT practice through follow-up assignments or improvement pilots.

#### Action Checklist
- Use an OJT tracker that states learning goals, mentors, and verification methods, and review progress regularly.
- Revisit delegation plans quarterly, monitor workload balance, and adjust support structures after responsibilities shift.
- Provide pre-briefs for external training (“What to learn, why it matters”) and schedule debriefs within a week.
- Update manuals, checklists, or knowledge bases when new skills are acquired.

### Section 6: Putting Learning into Practice and Lifting Performance

Learning only creates value when it changes behaviour. Create opportunities to apply new knowledge and measure its effect on team performance.

- **Stage practical trials**: Assign graduates of training to lead mini-projects or propose enhancements, and evaluate both results and learning process.
- **Share insights broadly**: Use team meetings to exchange lessons so improvements spread beyond the original participant.
- **Visualise outcomes**: Track indicators such as processing time, satisfaction scores, or error reductions to demonstrate impact.

#### Action Checklist
- Ask participants to submit a brief covering application ideas, implementation plans, and support needed.
- Display improvement metrics in dashboards or weekly notes to sustain momentum.
- Celebrate stories where learning improved service, reinforcing continuous improvement.

### Section 7: Personal Growth and Trust Building

Leadership credibility grows from daily conduct. Middle managers set the tone by modelling integrity, self-discipline, and inclusive behaviour.

- **Learn from role models**: Identify strengths in supervisors or peers—communication, composure, adaptability—and experiment with adopting them. Conduct periodic self-reviews to track growth areas.
- **Practise self-management**: Lead by example on punctuality, adherence to policies, and professional etiquette. Manage stress responses so coaching conversations stay constructive.
- **Earn trust consistently**: Treat faculty, students, and colleagues with the same respect regardless of personal preference. Transparency and fairness are non-negotiable.

#### Action Checklist
- Every six months, define the leader you aspire to be and list behaviours to strengthen.
- Audit your own rule compliance and interpersonal signals; correct gaps before coaching others.
- Seek feedback from different stakeholder groups to gauge credibility and adjust approach.
